        <div><h1>Cory Doctorow’s craphound.com  &gt;&gt; Blog Archive   » Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom: Utopianism and the problems with Whuffie</h1><blockquote readability="29"><p>
        CD: I based Whuffie at the time more on Slashdot’s Karma, and I don’t know that Faceook has an exact analogue to it. I guess Facebook has this thing where you can see who has the most inbound links, who has the most friends, and you can “digg” up yourself by getting more of those.</p>
        <p>
        I think that in general we have a pathological response to anything we measure. We tend not to measure the thing we care about; we tend to measure something that indicates its presence. It’s often very hard to measure the thing that you’re hoping for. You don’t actually care about how calories you eat; you care about how much weight you’re going to gain from the calories you eat. But as soon as we go, oh, well, calories are a pretty good proxy for weight gain, we start to come up with these foods that are incredibly unhealthy but nevertheless have very few calories in them. In the same way, Google doesn’t really care about inbound links because inbound links are good per se; Google cares about inbound links because inbound links are a good proxy for “someone likes this page; someone thinks this page is a useful place to be, is a good place to be.” But as soon as Google starts counting that, people start finding ways to make links that don’t actually serve as a proxy for that conclusion at all.</p>
        <p>
        GDP is another good example. We don’t care about GDP because GDP itself is good; we care about GDP because the basket of indicators that we measure with GDP are a proxy for the overall health of the society—except as soon as you start measuring GDP, people figure out how to make the GDP go up by doing things like trading derivatives of derivates of subprime subderivates of derivatives, but which actually does the reverse of what we care about by undermining the quality of life and the stability of society.</p>
        <p>
        So I think that one of the biggest problems that Google has, taking Google as probably the best example of someone trying to build a reputation currency, is that as soon as Google gives you any insight into how they are building their reputation system it ceases to be very good as a reputation system. As soon as Google stops measuring something you created by accident and starts measuring something you created on purpose, it stops being something that they want to measure. And this is joined by the twin problem that what Google fundamentally has is a security problem; they have hackers who are trying to undermine the integrity of the system. And the natural response to a problem that arises when attackers know how your system works is to try to keep the details of your system secret—but keeping the details of Google’s system secret is also not very good because it means that we don’t have any reason to trust it. All we know when we search Google is that we get a result that seems like a good result; but we don’t know that there isn’t a much better result that Google has either deliberately or accidentally excluded from its listings for reasons that are attributable to either malice or incompetence. So they’re really trapped between a rock and a hard place: if they publish how their system works, people will game their system; if they don’t publish how their system works it becomes less useful and trustworthy and good. It suffers from the problem of alchemy; if alchemists don’t tell people what they learned, then every alchemist needs to discover for themselves that drinking mercury is a bad idea, and alchemy stagnates. When you start to publishing, you get science—but Google can’t publish or they’ll also get more attacks.</p>
        <p>
        So it’s a really thorny, thorny problem, and I elide that problem with Whuffie by imagining a completely undescribed science fictional system that can disambiguate every object in the universe so when you look at something and have a response to it the system knows that the response is being driven by the color of the car but not by the car, or the shirt but not the person wearing it, or the person wearing it and not the shirt, and also know how you feel about it. So it can know what you’re feeling and what you’re feeling it about. And I don’t actually think we have a computer that could that; I don’t think we have Supreme Court judges or Ph.D. philosophers that can do that.

            </footer><p>Before or after you’re sharing your own code as open-source, you might find yourself itching to fix someone else’s code.</p>
        <p>Twelve months ago I made my first contribution to someone else’s project – I added some auto-generated tests to the AjaxScaffold project (now ActiveScaffold and no longer a rails generator). It was the first RubyGem I really investigated. It was the first Rails Generator I investigated. It was the first <span class="caps">OSS</span> project I think I’ve ever submitted a patch to. It took days.</p>
        <h2>Its always the same process</h2>
        <p>Yesterday I created a patch for <a href="http://merb.rubyforge.org">Merb</a>: an update to their <span class="caps">README</span> file so it converted to RDoc nicely. The whole patching process: spotting the ugly <span class="caps">README</span>, checking out merb trunk, changing its <span class="caps">README</span>, testing, creating a patch, and submitting it to Merb’s trac, took about 30 minutes whilst also doing other things.</p>
        <p>The process was the same, I’m just better at it.</p>
        <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
        <p>So here’s how to fix other people’s code. It has Ruby-specific examples, but I’m sure the process is the same in all OSS communities. Its also worth checking out the slides from Josh Susser’s Railsconf talk on <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/5/24/laying-tracks-slides">contributing to Rails Core</a>.</p>
        <h3>1. Get annoyed by a defect or missing feature</h3>
        <p>Open source software isn’t written by an army of coders, with a back up army of testers, documenters, and “Dummies Guide” book authors. Rather, its code that fixed the author’s problem; and they were nice enough to flesh it out generically so you could use it. Or they were seeking fame and glory.</p>
        <p>So you find problems. The project owner and all its users will be super grateful if you fix it for them.</p>
        <h3>2. Finding the source</h3>
        <p>The modern Ruby community uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion/svn</a> for their source repositories. So now is your excuse to install it and start to learn how to use it.</p>
        <p>The tricky part is “where is the repository?”</p>
        <p>If the project has a RubyForge project go to  (if its <span class="caps">URL</span> is <code>http://XYZ.rubyforge.org</code>, then its project page is <code>http://rubyforge.org/projects/XYZ</code>) then try the “SCM” tab on the project page. If the project isn’t hosting on RubyForge <span class="caps">SVN</span>, hopefully they have disabled this menu tab. If not, you’ll get version 0 when you do the checkout to tell you the project’s not hosted here.</p>
        <p>Alternately, the project’s homepage/README file should tell you where the repository is.</p>
        <p>Finally, email the project owner. And tell them to get their act together and publicise their <span class="caps">SVN</span> repos.</p>
        <h3>3. Checkout the source</h3>
        <p>Hopefully you’re told the complete <span class="caps">URL</span> to the trunk of the project. For anonymous access to the <code>newgem</code> RubyForge project the <span class="caps">URL</span> is <a href="svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/newgem/trunk">svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/newgem/trunk</a></p>
        <p>A project <span class="caps">SVN</span> repository might contain multiple projects, and may or may not use the common trunk/branches/tags root folders. So you may need to navigate around the repository and til you find the trunk of the project’s code.</p>
        <p>So for a generic RubyForge project, the root <span class="caps">URL</span> for anonymous access is <code>svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/XYZ</code>.</p>
        <pre>$ svn list svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/newgem
        branches/
        tags/
        trunk/
        $ svn list svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/newgem<strong>/trunk</strong>
        History.txt
        ...
        </pre>
        <p>[Thx to Seth - originally I suggested doing a checkout; but <code>list</code> is cleaner.]</p>
        <p>If there is a <strong>trunk</strong> root folder, then do the following:</p>
        <pre>rm -rf XYZ
        svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/XYZ/trunk XYZ
        cd XYZ
        </pre>
        <p>And now you’ve checked out the trunk or “edge” of the project. The latest and greatest.</p>
        <h3>4. Snoop around</h3>
        <p>Load up the project into your editor and poke around.</p>
        <p>If it has test cases (!) try running them. You may need to create some databases and/or modify the Rakefile/connection details to work with your database. Hopefully the project comes with rake tasks to create/drop the databases. <code>rake -T</code> should find them.</p>
        <p>If its a RubyGem, try installing the gem locally (on top of the existing defective gem that you’re about to fix). Again, run <code>rake -T</code> and hopefully there is a task <code>install_gem</code> or similar to build and install the gem from source. If not, send hate mail to the author. And then fix the Rakefile to use the Hoe gem. And then send a patch to the author with the fixed Rakefile.</p>
        <p><code>rake install_gem</code></p>
        <h3>5. Make changes</h3>
        <p>Finally, you get to change their code.</p>
        <p>If the project has a suite of test cases, please make an effort to add “failing test cases”. That is, add test cases that demonstrate the defect by failing (unless the project includes your fix).</p>
        <p>Run the tests to ensure they are working.</p>
        <h3>6. Refresh the code from the repository (svn up)</h3>
        <p>The original repository may have changed since you did the checkout, so update your version.</p>
        <pre>svn up</pre>
        <p>If there are any conflicts, go fix them and delete any helper files created by <span class="caps">SVN</span>.</p>
        <h3>7. Create the patch</h3>
        <p>First, you need to tell subversion about any folders/files you’ve added (<code>svn add</code>) or deleted (<code>svn remove</code>).</p>
        <p>Then, from the root folder of the trunk:</p>
        <pre>svn diff &gt; i_fixed_a_bug.patch</pre>
        <p>Give the patch file a useful, readable name. Like <code>readme_updated_for_rdoc_syntax.patch</code>.</p>
        <p><a name="8a-trac"/></p>
        <h3>8a. Submit patch to trac</h3>
        <p>[<a href="#8a-trac">link to 8a</a>]</p>
        <p>Each project may have a different preferred way to submit patches.</p>
        <p>If the project uses <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> then:</p>
        <ol><li>Register an account (normally a link at the top right of the page) if available. Some trac installations require an account (e.g. <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) and others allow anonymous tickets.</li>
        <li>Click “<strong>New Ticket</strong>” </li>
        <li>Fill in details (note, there is nowhere initially to add your patch). Prefix the subject with [PATCH]</li>
        <li>Save the ticket (check the box “Attach files”)</li>

        <div><h1>Back of the Cereal Box: Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde: Smarter Than You Think</h1><div class="post-body" readability="110">
        <p>At the moment, I am haunted by the ghosts of <em>Pac-Man</em>. Unlike regular hauntings, which more often make people go crazy or become possessed or move away, this timely supernatural occurrence has prompted me to write another entry in <a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/search/label/some%20strange%20intersection%20of%20video%20games%20and%20all%20things%20verbal">the games-and-names file</a>.</p><p>Way back when, I blogged about a prolonged night at Elsie’s in which I <a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2005/05/power-pills.html">sat next to the <em>Pac-Man</em> machine</a> and ended up watching the attract mode for way longer than I should have. As the lights flashed and repeatedly drew my attention, I watched the introduction of the game’s characters again and again and I noted that the four ghosts have two sets of names. Where as the four are introduced as <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Blinky">Blinky</a> (the red one), <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Pinky">Pinky</a> (the pink one), <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Inky">Inky</a> (the blue one) and <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Clyde">Clyde</a> (the orange one), they’re also given an alternate set of names: <span>Shadow</span>, <span>Speedy</span>, <span>Bashful</span> and <span>Pokey</span>, respectively.</p><p></p><br />It gets weirder: This particular machine was one of the ones that contains all the major <em>Pac-Man</em> games and therefore scrolled through them, one by one. The included ghosts change. In <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em>, Clyde is replaced by another orange ghost, <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Sue">Sue</a>, possibly in an effort to even out the gender ratio. In <em>Pac-Man Jr.</em>, Sue is replaced with Tim, also orange.<p>But it all seems arbitrary, right?</p><p>In a sense, it is. However, Ashley Davis, a blogger over at Destructoid, put a post up last week specifically on the <em>Pac-Man</em> ghosts and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blinky-inky-pinky-and-clyde-a-small-onomastic-study-108669.phtml">why they got the names that they did</a>. In short, though it might seem like Blinky, Pinky, Inky and the Clyde-Sue-Tim hivemind hover around dot-filled mazes in the exact same way, they don’t. In fact, the way they move is explained by their nicknames.</p><p>As Davis explains it, Clyde (a.k.a. “Pokey”) might seem like he’d move especially slowly, but he doesn’t. Instead, he moves around at a normal speed but not at all in pursuit of Pac-Man. He does his own thing; if he happens to snag Pac-Man and make him rotate counterclockwise into oblivion, it’s a total coincidence. His Japanese name, <em>Otoboke</em>, translates to something like “stupid” or “dopey,” Davis explains. Thus, “Pokey” — or, as we shall interpret it, “mentally challenged.” Thus, if Clyde kills Pac-Man, it’s probably as a result of the player being equally as mentally challenged.</p><p>Inky, as Davis explains it, is equally unlikely to kill Pac-Man. His Japanese name, <em>Kimagure</em>, translates to “whimsy.” And it might seem like his pattern is based on pure whimsy, but it’s apparently not. As it’s explained <a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=12231">on the Twin Galaxies forum</a>, Inky’s position on the screen may seem random, but it’s actually based on a the relationship between Pac-Man and Blinky, the red ghost. More or less, Inky resides on the part of the screen that’s twice as far from the distance between the red ghost and two spaces in front of Pac-Man. It’s very complex.</p><p>Pinky (a.k.a. “Speedy”) doesn’t actually move any faster than the rest of the ghosts. His Japanese name — <em>Machibuse</em>, “ambusher” — is more accurate, as she takes it upon herself to trap Pac-Man into corners with the help of the Blinky. (<a href="http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/games/pac-man.htm">This website,</a> by the way, switches the Japanese names for Inky and Pinky, but since it’s in the minority on the matter, I’ll assume it’s a mistake.)</p><p>And then there’s Blinky (a.k.a. “Shadow”). In Japanese, he’s <em>Oikake</em>, “chaser.” He bases his movements on Pac-Man himself, always with the goal of reducing the amount of distance between himself and the yellow dot-gobbler. If the vertical distance is greater, he’ll do what he can to reduce that so long as the horizontal distance doesn’t become greater, in which case he’ll reduce that instead. Davis notes that when Pac-Man consumes a certain number of dots, the behavior of Blinky — and only Blinky — changes. He goes into what is known among <em>Pac-Man</em> aficionados as “Cruise Elroy” mode. (Davis supplies some guesses as to where the term might come from, but she rightly leaves it as being obscure.) In this mode, Blinky moves faster than he would normally be able to.</p><p>Interesting, in my book, for two reasons: The four ghosts each have their own programmed motivation for getting around a given maze (one) and these motivations are hinted at by their names (two).</p><p>Davis leaves out one additional ghost, however, who’s little known even among those who pride themselves in their <em>Pac-Man</em> skills: the especially obscure green ghost, Miru (also translated as “Mil,” unfortunately). I read about her while browsing Wikipedia sometime back and had been meaning to reveal her existence to the world for a while before the Destructoid post gave me an opportunity. Miru appears in the 1983 Japan-only title <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_&amp;_Pal">Pac &amp; Pal</a></em>, which Wikipedia alleges could be the rarest <em>Pac-Man</em> title.</p><p></p><br />I’m fairly certain that Miru is the only truly female ghost in the series, Sue and Pinky’s names notwithstanding. You can tell by the fact that she, like Ms. Pac-Man herself, wears a bow on her head. And that’s a sure a sign of femininity as there ever was. (She looks like “a gooseberry with legs,” according to Wikipedia.) She apparently zooms around the maze, unaffected by the evil ghosts, and will grab items. If Pac-Man doesn’t intercept them from her, they get dropped in the “ghost box” in the center of the maze, where they become lost forever.<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQVjOHCeDmI/AAAAAAAACLc/5imAmTVLAhg/s1600-h/pac_%26_pan_miru.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQVjOHCeDmI/AAAAAAAACLc/5imAmTVLAhg/s400/pac_%26_pan_miru.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261720833711017570" border="0" /></a><br />In short, Miru doesn’t sound like all that much help. In some versions, she’s apparently replaced by <a href="http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Chomp-Chomp">Chomp-Chomp</a>, Pac-Man’s dog. If that’s not a slap in the face to early gender equality in video games, I don’t know what is.</p><p></p><br />And that, my friends, is everything I know about the <em>Pac-Man</em> ghosts, their weird alternate personas, their additional American alteregos, and their dumb little sister that no one talks about anymore.<p>EDIT: <em>I’ve found a bit more on the ghosts. First, what’s in the comments below is accurate. </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Mania">Pac-mania</a><em> did, in fact, introduce new ghosts into the mix. The green one is, in fact, named </em>Funky<em> and the gray one </em>Spunky<em>, though they’re also apparently known as the far less fun-sounding “Common” and “Gray Common.” And Sue does reappear, now purple.</em></p><p><em>However, these aren’t the last of the ghosts. There’s also one named </em>Yum-Yum<em>, who appears in </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man">Jr. Pac-Man</a><em> as some kind of Juliet to Jr. Pac-Man’s Romeo. The latter’s boyhood is represented by the fact that he wears a little propeller beanie on his head, while the former’s femininity is once again represented by the fact that she wears a bow. Below is a screenshot, which I nabbed from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4XJQuWKeT0">this YouTube clip</a>.</em></p><p><em>Here’s Jr. Pac-Man, just after he’s dropped off by the stork.</em></p><p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQ_eNMb-wGI/AAAAAAAACU0/EqhvDyD9KyY/s1600-h/jr_pac-man_1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQ_eNMb-wGI/AAAAAAAACU0/EqhvDyD9KyY/s400/jr_pac-man_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264670807677648994" border="0" /></a><br /><em>And here’s little Yum-Yum meeting Jr. for the first time.</em></p><p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQ_eNCRy6nI/AAAAAAAACU8/3YmTU7Di4Bc/s1600-h/jr_pac-man_2_yum_yum.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1I7KiCuAU4k/SQ_eNCRy6nI/AAAAAAAACU8/3YmTU7Di4Bc/s400/jr_pac-man_2_yum_yum.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264670804950575730" border="0" /></a><br /><em>Finally, regarding the big four ghosts, I noticed in Chris Kohler’s </em>Game Over<em> a little section on their names. He translated the Japanese names of Clyde, Inky, Pinky and Blinky as “Slow,” “Capricious,” “Ambush” and “Chaser.” He also notes that the four Japanese versions of the ghosts have their own Japanese nicknames, just as the American versions have nicknames. The nicknames, in order are </em>Guzuta<em>, </em>Aosuke<em>, </em>Pinky<em> and </em>Akabei<em>, three of which are references to their respective ghosts’ colors. “Pinky” is obvious. The Japanese word for “red” is </em>aka<em>, and the word for “blue” is </em>ao<em>. Kohler theorizes that Guzuta comes from the Japanese </em>guzutsuku<em>, meaning “to linger” or “to languish.” Now we know.</em></p><p><span>Pac-Man</span>, previously:<a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2008/08/first-lady-of-video-games.html"><br /></a></p><ul><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2008/08/first-lady-of-video-games.html">The First Lady of Video Games</a></li><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2007/11/thrill-of-chase-without-dots.html">The Thrill of the Chase Without the Dots</a></li><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2007/04/his-phallic-nose.html">His Phallic Nose</a></li></ul>The intersection of video games and all things verbal, elsewhere on this blog:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2009/09/its-secret-to-everybody-part-fourteen.html">It’s    a Secret to Everybody, Part Fourteen: <span>Pac-Man</span> and other odds and ends<br /></a></li><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2009/06/its-secret-to-everybody.html">The BIG post on video game name etymologies</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2008/10/ogopogo-lives.html">Ogopogo Lives</a></li><li><a href="http://kidicarus222.blogspot.com/2008/10/legacy-of-wa-stokins.html">The Legacy of W.A.

        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the fall of 1998, Steve Safranek, a devout Catholic professor, found himself at a crossroads. For nearly a decade, he had been teaching at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, a small Catholic enclave in the heart of the rust belt, and, like many institutions in the region, it was undergoing wrenching change. Enrollment had taken such a tumble that administrators were considering cutting a third of the faculty, and there was growing anxiety among conservative professors, who felt the school was drifting from its traditional Catholic roots. The turmoil only deepened that September when a pro-choice Michigan Supreme Court justice was invited to give the oath at the annual Red Mass, a centuries-old ceremony where Catholic lawyers, judges, and politicians ask God’s blessing and guidance in their daily work. Some faculty and staff turned out with picket signs; others, like Safranek, simply chose not to attend. This touched off a bitter dispute with the administration.</p>
        
        <p>Around this time, Safranek decided he would pray every day for fifty-four days straight to St. Thomas More, the Renaissance lawyer and statesman who coined the word “utopia.” As he recited his Hail Marys, an idea began to percolate: Why not start a new Catholic law school? A few weeks later, Safranek caught word that Tom Monaghan, the eccentric billionaire who founded Domino’s Pizza, had sold his business and was planning to devote his fortune to conservative Catholic causes. So he hashed out a proposal and got four other University of Detroit Mercy professors and an administrator to sign on. To show they were serious, each of them offered to chip in $20,000 and work for free for a year.</p>
        
        <p>Monaghan was intrigued. In early December, he invited Safranek and the others to Domino’s Farm, a half-mile-long office complex with numerous quirky amenities— among them a herd of buffalo and a petting zoo—which he had built in Ann Arbor Township. The group met in a small, sparsely furnished room, where they discussed their ideas for the new venture. “There was some talk about Catholic law schools, generally; most American ones were started as technical professional entities to keep graduates of Catholic colleges around for three more years,” Safranek recalls. “We wanted to build something different—a school where traditional Catholic values and thought were built into every part of the curriculum.” At the same time, Safranek and company wanted to avoid the trap that many new schools fall into; because they’re strapped for cash, they end up with scantly stocked libraries, second-rate faculty, and middling students. Their aim was to build a world-class institution, one that would churn out lawyers capable of leaving their stamp on the larger culture.</p>
        
        <p>Once the professors were done speaking, Monaghan went around the table and asked them one by one if he could count on their commitment. They all said he could. Monaghan then promised to throw his financial might behind the project—while he didn’t settle on a specific dollar figure, the numbers he batted around were in the tens of millions. Finally, the group retreated to Monaghan’s office, a two-story suite with raw-silk ceilings and leather floors, for drinks and hors d’oeuvres. Through the window, they could see buffalo grazing and a light snow falling on the brown hills.</p>
        
        <p>After the meeting, Monaghan approached Bernard Dobranski, the dean of the law school at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and asked him to head up the new venture, known as Ave Maria School of Law. It was a risky proposition for a seasoned academic— giving up tenure, a generous salary, and the promise of long sabbaticals to take part in a startup venture. But the idea piqued Dobranski’s interest. The following day, he asked his friend, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, to lunch and sought his advice. Scalia pressed him to take the job. The conservative justice was later flown out on Monaghan’s private jet to consult on the curriculum. Scalia was so enthusiastic about the project that he also persuaded his friend Robert Bork, the erstwhile conservative Supreme Court nominee, to join the faculty. Before long other prominent conservatives were lining up behind the project. They were so enamored with the idea, and the money Monaghan was willing to put behind it, that no one seemed to give much thought to the implications of a fast-food mogul wading into the world of higher ed.</p>
        
        <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>om Monaghan was born in 1937 on the outskirts of Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father, a truck driver, died when he was just four years old, and his mother was unable to support him and his younger brother on the $27.50 a week she earned as a maid. The boys spent a couple years bouncing between foster homes before landing at St. Joseph’s Home for Boys, a Catholic orphanage in Jackson, Michigan. It was a harsh existence. When they weren’t saying their rosaries, the boys spent hours on end ironing and scrubbing floors. Punishment was doled out with a strap, often wielded by the feared Sister Ladislaus.</p>
        
        
        <p>To escape, Monaghan turned to fantasy. He mused about becoming a priest or a shortstop for the Detroit Tigers, and imagined trading in his threadbare clothes for elegant belongings. “I would dream of having things—not the <i>good</i> or the <i>better</i>, but the <i>best</i>,” Monaghan writes in his memoir, <i>Pizza Tiger</i>. “And I could visualize them so perfectly, it was like actually possessing them. I would picture my house or cabin and sometimes I would even build it in my imagination.” These mental building projects later gave way to a fascination with architecture. Monaghan spent his teenage years plowing through books on Frank Lloyd Wright. He hoped to one day follow in the great architect’s footsteps, but this dream turned out to be beyond his reach. Monaghan graduated at the bottom of his high school class and enrolled in a seminary, but he was kicked out because he “lacked vocation.” A few years later, he moved to Ann Arbor with the hopes of studying architecture at the University of Michigan, but his finances were shaky and his math skills lacking. Though he enrolled three times, he never completed a single semester.</p>
        
        <p>Then, in the winter of 1960, Monaghan and his brother heard that a man in Ypsilanti had a pizzeria he was looking to sell on the cheap. The pair managed to scrape together $75 for the down payment, and before long they were slinging pizzas. A few months later, Monaghan traded a Volkswagen Beetle for his brother’s share of the business. If he couldn’t be an architect, he decided, he would throw himself into building a pizza empire.</p>
        
        <p>For all his struggles in the classroom, Monaghan turned out to be a brilliant businessman. Early on, he dropped sub sandwiches from his menu and began focusing on delivery to college campuses, which was far more lucrative than sit-down service. He also invented a new insulated pizza box. Unlike its chipboard predecessors, it could be stacked without squishing the pizzas inside. This allowed him to deliver more pies per trip, and assured they were warm when they arrived. Monaghan eventually began spreading his model to other college towns, and by the mid-1980s, nearly three new Domino’s franchises were opening every day.</p>
        
        <p>The key to Domino’s growth was a tightly controlled franchise system. When a new store opened, headquarters would send a truck stocked with everything from pizza ovens to forks and aprons. Store managers worked from a thick operations manual, known as “the Bible,” which dictated every aspect of operations, down to the smallest detail. Monaghan also kept a tight rein on his employees: store workers were barred from sitting down during their shifts, and executives were expected to uproot their lives and move across the country on Monaghan’s whim. At headquarters, female staffers had to wear skirts or dresses that fell below the knees—pants were strictly forbidden.</p>
        
        <p>As Monaghan’s business grew, so did his appetite for spending. He bought a Gulfstream jet, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter, and a fleet of cars—among them the Packard that had ferried Franklin Roosevelt to his 1933 inauguration, and a handmade Bugatti Royale. (The latter cost him $8 million, the most ever paid for a classic car.) He also began buying up Frank Lloyd Wright homes, and assembled the world’s largest collection of Wright furniture. But his most famous purchase was the Detroit Tigers, which he bought in 1983. When the team won the World Series the following year, Monaghan had his private helicopter ferry hundreds of Domino’s pizzas to Tiger Stadium.</p>
        
        <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven during his prodigal years, Monaghan never lost sight of his Catholic roots. And beginning in the mid-1980s, he started delving more deeply into his faith, and embracing conservative Catholic causes. Then, in 1989, at the suggestion of a Catholic scholar friend, he read a passage from the C. S. Lewis classic <i>Mere Christianity</i> that railed against pride as “the essential vice, the utmost evil.” It dawned on Monaghan that his hunger for success and flashy belongings was pride in its purest form. He immediately swore what he called a “millionaire’s vow of poverty” and began shedding his possessions. Finally, in 1998, he sold Domino’s for an estimated $1 billion and announced that he was retiring from the pizza business so he could devote his time and money to Catholic education. “I want to die broke,” he declared.</p>
        
        <p>It was later that year that Safranek and the other professors approached Monaghan with their idea for the Catholic law school. Their timing couldn’t have been better; Monaghan was already busy piecing together his educational empire. His first act had been to found Ave Maria College, a Catholic school in Ypsilanti. But he had trouble getting accreditation for the stand-alone venture, so he struck a deal to take over St. Mary’s College, a 120-year-old Catholic school in nearby Orchard Lake Village. In exchange for its accreditation charter, he would give the struggling institution the cash it needed to thrive—among other things, Monaghan planned to beef up the faculty and build a division-one football team. (Or, as St. Mary’s then President Thaddeus Radzilowski recalls, “He wanted a school that produced three-hundred-pound tackles who were also theology majors.”)</p>
        
        
        <p>Shortly after their seminal meeting with Monaghan, Safranek and the others negotiated buyouts from the University of Detroit Mercy, packed up their belongings, and moved to Ann Arbor. For most, this move came with some sacrifices. Safranek gave up tenure and a seat on the city council, and sold the home he had just bought for his wife and seven children, a brick abode with a vegetable garden near Lake Sinclair. But they were too wrapped up in their new venture to have regrets.</p>
        
        <p>The professors set up shop in a bank of cubicles at Domino’s Farms, which housed, among other things, the headquarters of Domino’s Pizza. From there, they began putting together the curriculum and recruiting professors. Dobranski eventually drew up a list of thirty-six luminaries of Catholic legal education (he called them his “dream team”) and began contacting them with a personal invitation to join the faculty. Before long, inquiries from prospective students were pouring in. In the fall of 2000, when Ave Maria School of Law opened the doors to its new campus—an 85,000-square-foot Frank Lloyd Wright–style building in northeast Ann Arbor—it had seventy-five students, almost double the initial projections. Their bona fides, namely LSAT scores, were on par with students at many top-tier law schools. Suddenly, Monaghan—a college dropout who had made his fortune delivering pizzas to dorm rooms—was in the inner circle of what was shaping up to be an elite academic club.</p>
        
        <p>From the beginning, Monaghan insisted he wouldn’t meddle in the law school’s daily operations. As he put it in an interview with the<i> Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, “When I owned the Detroit Tigers, I didn’t climb into the dugout and tell Sparky how to set his lineup.” But behind the scenes, he was quietly amassing control. Monaghan appointed himself chairman of the board. According to deposition testimony that Monaghan and his deputies later gave, Dean Dobranski was also given an employment contract with Monaghan’s private foundation rather than with Ave Maria law school. This meant the dean answered directly to Monaghan and not the board of governors, which was supposed to be in charge. Dobranski was also obligated to send the former pizza mogul daily writeups of his activities, to which Monaghan would reply with detailed instructions. What’s more, money for both the law school and the colleges was doled out in dribs and drabs, which allowed Monaghan to keep a tight rein on their operations. (St. Mary’s administrators, for instance, recall pleading with Monaghan’s foundation for $75 to pay the referees at a baseball game.) None of this really mattered as long as he and the faculty were driving toward the same vision. It was only when Monaghan hit on his next grand scheme that things began to unravel.</p>
        
        <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>y early 2002, Monaghan had three promising schools—Ave Maria College, St. Mary’s, and Ave Maria School of Law—but they were scattered across Michigan. In the hopes of bringing them together on a single campus, he submitted plans to build a new Ave Maria University at Domino’s Farms. The proposal might have sailed through unnoticed if it weren’t for one detail: a 250-foot crucifix. That’s taller than the old General Motors building and almost as tall as the Statue of Liberty. The idea touched off a firestorm in Ann Arbor Township, a wealthy rural community with roughly 5,000 residents near the city of Ann Arbor. Many locals still nursed resentments over Monaghan’s previous architectural ventures; years earlier he had tried to build the “Leaning Tower of Pizza,” a thirty-five-story copper-and-bronze-clad tower with a slight eastward slant. A few also grumbled that the onetime pizza baron—who had already opened two convents, a pair of Catholic radio stations, and a Catholic newspaper in the area—was trying to turn the township into a theocracy.</p>
        
        <p>In the end, the local planning commission denied his petition to build the university, and Monaghan was forced to look further afield. He eventually settled on a scraggly stretch of tomato fields bordering southwest Florida’s Corkscrew Swamp. The site was twenty miles inland of Naples, which has a high concentration of Catholics and conservatives, and Monaghan believed they would be friendlier to his vision. And, as luck would have it, Barron Collier Companies, a powerful local landowner, offered to donate some 750 acres on which to build the university. In return, Monaghan agreed to work with Barron Collier to build a planned community around the school, with the profit split down the middle.</p>
        
        
        <p>What they envisioned was an old-fashioned company town with a theocratic twist. Monaghan and Barron Collier would own everything from the local utility company to the building supply that provided concrete for wells and foundations. But the most startling part of the whole arrangement was the plan for governing the community. In Florida, developers can petition to act as the local government for a number of years while a development is under construction. Monaghan and Barron Collier began pushing the Florida state legislature to pass a law that would allow them to control the local government in perpetuity—and, according to an investigation by the <i>Naples Daily News</i>, they eventually succeeded. While their powers were technically limited when it came to regulating behavior, they clearly intended to keep a tight grip on community life. The original letter of intent between Barron Collier and Monaghan said the town would “allow no public activities which are offensive to traditional Christian values or which might represent a scandal to Catholic and Christian sensibilities. Thus, no topless bars, abortion clinics, ‘adult’ bookstores or the like shall be permitted.”</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps more importantly, the Florida project would allow Monaghan to indulge his passion for architecture. At the heart of town would sit an Italian-style piazza, flanked on one side by Monaghan’s giant crucifix and a 60,000-square-foot church inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. (Monaghan boasted at one point that he had sketched the original design for the church on a napkin.) The building was supposed to have the largest seating capacity of any Catholic church in America, though plans were later scaled back.</p>
        
        <p>Monaghan went public with his plans in late 2002, saying in a press conference that he would donate $220 million for a new university in Florida, which he said would eventually have 5,000 students and a world-class golf course that would host the “Catholic Augusta National.” The following fall, the university opened an interim campus in an existing development near Naples.</p>
        
        <p>As work got under way in Florida, financing for Monaghan’s Michigan projects began to evaporate. With only a few months’ notice, he severed ties with St. Mary’s and pulled most of the funding. The school would have been forced to shut down if another Catholic university hadn’t agreed to take it over at the last moment. Even so, it had to cut roughly half its faculty, and many students were forced to drop out because financial aid dried up. Despite promises from Monaghan to keep Ave Maria College open until 2007 so students could finish their degrees, administrators started moving to close it down, too. Professors say they were given a stark choice: move to Florida, or risk losing their jobs. Bewildered parents found themselves fighting back plans to pack up all the library books and ship them south. “It was like, ‘Whoa, wait a minute, you can’t just take all the books!’ ” recalls Therese Bower, whose son attended the school. Within two years, the student body had dwindled from 230 to around thirty, and Monaghan began offering the remaining students buyouts.</p>
        
        <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven as the other campuses descended into turmoil, however, Ave Maria School of Law continued to flourish. The first class, which graduated in 2003, had a 93 percent bar passage rate, the highest of any school in the state. (This prompted the <i>National Review</i> to quip that the University of Michigan—known for churning out powerhouse litigators and Supreme Court justices—had the “second-best law school in Ann Arbor.”) The following year, a staggering 100 percent of Ave Maria law school grads passed the Michigan bar on the first go-round. Many were also going on to high-powered jobs and prestigious clerkships. “We were hitting success after success,” says Joe Falvey, who was then associate dean. “Everything was clicking on all cylinders.”</p>
        
        <p>Why was the law school spared? The answer appears to hang on a technicality. Monaghan initially wanted to uproot it and move it to Florida, along with Ave Maria College. But in mid-2003, the board commissioned a feasibility study, which found the move could put the school’s pending ABA accreditation at risk. Shortly after that, the board announced that it had tabled the idea of relocating. But behind closed doors, planning for the move continued. According to Falvey, who regularly attended board meetings, plans were drawn up for a $30 million law school building on the Florida campus—it would sit just across from “Mansion Row,” a grassy promenade lined with stately homes belonging to university officials.</p>
        
        
        <p>At one point early on, Monaghan invited the law school board to Naples for a stay at LaPlaya Beach &amp; Golf Resort, a four-star hotel with a tiki bar overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. While there, the group met with Barron Collier executives, who laid out their plans, including those for the new law school building. By this time Charlie Rice, a founding board member and professor emeritus at Notre Dame, was beginning to have grave doubts about the project. “I thought, This is going to be a train wreck,” he recalls. “We’re going to uproot this thriving law school and move it to the campus of some nonexistent university before we even know if the whole thing is viable?” According to attendees, and a string of memos, Rice suggested that the board agree to consult faculty and students before committing to a move, and give them at least four years’ notice. He also pressed for a secure endowment, so the school wouldn’t be dependent on one person. Monaghan came unglued. (He later sent Rice a letter saying, “I am writing to express my embarrassment over my inability to control my emotions.”) After that, the struggle between the two men only grew more bitter. According to Falvey and Rice, Monaghan eventually began threatening to pull funding for the school if the board refused to move it to Florida. Rice, meanwhile, grew increasingly shrill in his resistance. At one point he wrote Monaghan saying, “If you succeed in your effort to compel the Board to vote to relocate, you will find that you have relocated merely a name and an empty shell.” (Monaghan did not respond to requests for an interview.)</p>
        
        <p>Gradually, details of the conflict and the looming move leaked out, and it had a toxic effect on the school. By 2005, the quality of applicants was dropping, and the most promising students were transferring out by the dozen. To keep the student body from collapsing, administrators had to give out ever-larger scholarships. This had the perverse effect of making the school, which was supposed to be financially independent by 2010, even more dependent on Monaghan. Despite the turmoil, in August 2005 the ABA granted Ave Maria law school final accreditation, meaning it could begin openly pursuing the move to Florida. The following month, the board voted to impose term limits, a move many students and faculty saw as a ploy to push Rice out.</p>
        
        <p>Rice’s ouster, combined with a poor showing in the <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> rankings several months later, heightened the sense among faculty and students that Monaghan and the administration would stop at nothing to push through the move to Florida, even if it meant destroying the school. What started as rumbling discontent burgeoned into full-scale revolt. In mid-2006, the faculty held a vote of no confidence in the dean, and roughly two-thirds voted in favor. Alumni and students followed suit, with their own no-confidence vote and, later, a call for Monaghan’s removal as chairman of the board. But the uproar made little difference. The following February, the board voted overwhelmingly to move the law school to Florida.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, the administration began cracking down on agitators. “Monaghan wanted no dissent, so the screws began to get turned,” says Safranek. No one was targeted more aggressively than the former University of Detroit Mercy professor. Safranek, who was among the most outspoken in his criticism of the school’s management, was repeatedly disciplined, often for seemingly trumped-up offenses. At one point, he received a letter saying he had been found guilty of “uninvited” touching of “the person of one of the Law School staff employees,” an accusation that smacked of sexual impropriety. What actually happened only became clear much later, when the contents of Safranek’s employee file—including a written statement from the alleged victim—were released as the result of a lawsuit: Safranek had walked by the dean’s secretary while she was shuffling through the trunk of her car in the law school parking lot, tapped her on the arm, and said, “Good morning, Sarah.”</p>
        
        <p>Based on these and other allegations, Safranek had his tenure revoked in July 2007. Since that time, he’s been hunting, without success, for another faculty position. By now he’s lost hope of ever working in academia again. “I try not to have regrets,” he says. “But for twenty years, teaching was my life. Sometimes I have the feeling that everything I’ve done has been for naught.” (Administrators declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding Safranek’s departure because he has a suit pending against the school. “Our policy is not to comment on matters before the court,” Dean Eugene Milhizer wrote in an e-mail.)</p>
        
        
        <p>Since Safranek’s ouster, the law school has been in a freefall. Most of the original faculty have fled or been pushed out, and the quality of the students has tumbled. One current professor told me, “Our student body now is one of the four or five worst in America.” The instability has also wreaked havoc on the school’s reputation: in the 2009 <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> law school rankings, Ave Maria tied for last place in the peer-assessment category, the most important measure in determining a school’s standing. (The school was not officially ranked because <i>U.S. News</i> doesn’t rank schools that land in the bottom tier.) Meanwhile, there are signs that Monaghan’s foundation, which funds the law school and the university, is on the verge of running out of money, in part because Monaghan bet his fortune—and the future of his nonprofits—on the now-crumbling Florida real estate market. Earlier this year, Ave Maria University’s second-longest-standing professor resigned, but not before sending a letter to administrators expressing his alarm at the school’s financial straits. “I fear that all of us (to different degrees) are participating in something that we may later deeply regret,” he wrote, “namely selling to young people and their families [an] educational product that we do not have sufficient reason to believe can be delivered.”</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, in June, the U.S. Department of Education reported that Ave Maria School of Law had failed its financial responsibility test, the only law school in the nation to do so. Even more troubling, the school ranked sixth to last among all American institutions of higher learning on the department’s financial responsibility index, thanks partly to its multimillion-dollar deficit. With its finances in disarray, the school has shelved plans for the $30 million building across from Mansion Row. When Ave Maria School of Law finally opened for business in Florida this August, it was in a former retirement home on the outskirts of Naples.</p>
        
        <p>Many who have lived through the turmoil at the law school and Monaghan’s other educational institutions believe that the root problem is his inability to grasp the difference between running a fast-food business and an institution of higher learning. “He views these schools as franchises that he can open and close at will like a pizza shop,” says Thomas Woods, a former dean of St. Mary’s. “He has this Cartesian view of the world—that you can dream up an idea in your head and impose it on the plastic substance of reality, like a cookie cutter on dough. But academic life is messier than that. Things have to be done by negotiation and persuasion. They have to be worked out over time.” Unfortunately for the professors and students who wagered their futures on his educational ventures, that kind of give and take simply isn’t Monaghan’s style.</p>

        <div><h1>The Escapist : TGC 2009: How a Board Game Can Make You Cry</h1><span id="intelliTXT" readability="40">
        <p>Brenda Brathwaite was in a bit of a rut.</p>
        <p>After 28 years in the game industry and a couple dozen titles shipped, she wanted a change of pace. As much as she enjoyed designing games and passing them onto burgeoning teams of programmers, artists and animators, she missed the satisfaction of doing everything herself. Digital games were great and all, but when she played a pair developed by different teams that felt nearly identical, she realized it was time to pull the plug.</p>
        <p>Thus began perhaps the most shocking, entertaining and awe-inspiring talk at this year's Triangle Game Conference, "How I Dumped Electricity and Learned to Love Design." </p>
        <p>Brathwaite's presentation focused on six experimental tabletop games she created on her short hiatus from digital development and how they re-ignited her passion for game design. The first game came about after a discussion with her 10-year-old daughter about an elementary school lesson on the slave trade. While her daughter had all the facts memorized, Brathwaite was dismayed to learn that she didn't grasp what the Middle Passage was like for the Africans who were kidnapped and shipped across the Atlantic. So she did what any game designer worth her salt would do: She made a game out of it.</p>
        <p>Brathwaite assembled a collection of tiny wooden figures, then had her daughter group them into "families." After her daughter was finished, she picked them up by the handful and placed them on a makeshift boat. Her daughter was confused: Why would she take the parents but leave the baby? Why wouldn't brothers stay with their sisters? "No one wants to go," Brathwaite explained. That's when it started to click.</p>
        <p>Then Brathwaite devised a primitive resource management mechanic. It took 10 turns for the boat to cross the Atlantic. The boat had 30 units of food. Each turn, the player had to roll a d6, and reduce their food stores by that number. By the trip's halfway point, it was clear to her daughter that her "cargo" wouldn't make it. It wasn't a "fun" game by any means, but it served a different purpose: It helped her daughter intuitively understand the emotional experience of the slave trade, a lesson that numbers on a chalkboard couldn't provide.</p>
        <p>At that point, Brathwaite was hooked.</p>
        <p>Her subsequent projects dealt with other uncomfortable historical moments. One simulated Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Ireland in the mid-17th century, a game wherein the object wasn't to win, but "to lose the least." But no one in the audience was prepared for her third game, unassumingly titled <em>Train</em>.</p>
        <p>The object of <em>Train</em> is to get a collection of people from Point A to Point B by placing them in a boxcar and sending them on their merry way. Played among a group of three people, players draw cards from a pile that can impede other players or free them from existing obstacles. The first player to reach the end of the line wins.</p>
        <p>The destination? Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>The "game" didn't stop there, however. The game board, pictured above, is an allusion to Kristallnacht - Brathwaite explained that she needed to break a fresh piece of glass each time she "installed" her work in a new location to properly evoke the violence of the experience. She even typed the game's instructions on an actual SS typewriter, which she purchased solely for that purpose.</p>
        <p>There were audible gasps in the audience when Brathwaite revealed <em>Train</em>'s shocking conclusion; one attendee was so moved by the experience that she left the conference room in tears. But Brathwaite's intention wasn't to invite controversy - just like her game about the Middle Passage, she wanted to create a game that affected people deeply. </p>
        <p>Judging from <em>Train</em>'s reception so far, she succeeded.</p></span></div>

        <p><b>Paul Ford</b>: I am leaving to pursue other opportunities. Not a euphemism! I'm working primarily with <a href="http://Activate.com">Activate</a>, which is the amazing new-media/technology convergence consulting micro-megacorporation that sprung fully formed from the heads of Anil Dash and Michael Wolf, and also with <a href="http://predicate-llc.com/">Predicate</a>, which is a powerhouse content strategy consultancy operated by Jeffrey MacIntyre. Both are working with me so that I can mention them in the Awl, so now I can invoice. <span id="more-31413"/></p>
        <p>I've been at <em>Harper's</em> for five years. It's very weird to be outside. Everyone has MacBooks. People use nouns as verbs. Someone wrote that they were going to f/u with me the other day, which concerned me, and someone else said that they looked forward to calendaring a meeting. Can I learn this strange new bird-language? I don't know. I'm planning to ride my bike to Newark soon, outside of bedbug range, and hit up the thrift stores so that I can have some emergency suits. Let's hope someone with size-54 shoulders recently died. Also I want to start <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/">my blog</a> up again. The most important thing any person can do in this world is get back to their blog. In my opinion.</p>
        <p><b>Choire</b>: Are rats sinking a deserted ship? [Jennifer Szalai, a senior editor, who handled reviews, also quit this week.] No wait, you know what I mean.</p>
        <p><b>Paul</b>: The rats are smoking a little too much, trying to figure out how why they can't get the layout to work in InDesign. Some rats are going, most rats are staying. Like everywhere. Here are some fun rat facts:  NYC's vaudeville union was called the White Rats. I <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/news_of_a_ratproofing.php">once wrote something</a> about ratproofing my apartment: The most common rat name is Slim. Rats can legally vote in Louisiana.</p>
        <p> <b>Choire</b>: Are you a rat? Or will you be "consulting" with your former employer?</p>
        <p><b>Paul</b>: You think I don't see your little insinuating quote marks? I'm still an editor, dammit. You can't slip things like that past me! I will not be "'consulting'," I will be <blink><b>CONSULTING</b></blink>.</p>
        <p>This has been very amiable and kind of sad for everyone involved, except for the people who have secretly hated me for years. I plan to pop back in before too long and finish up the re-code of the site in Django and make it easier for editors to work on the site through a web interface, and basically make everything go okay. I'll have a relationship of some kind with the magazine until I'm an old web coot telling young people about how we edited our HTML by hand rather than having our digital sex pony avatars do it for us in our Farmbooks. Which is basically me now talking to anyone younger than 27.</p>
        <p>You know what happened, really and without irony? I had an opportunity to be an editor at <i>Harper's</i>, to edit pieces for the magazine. It was something I expected to really want. I had wonderful editors to learn from. I did a little of it for print and a lot for the web. I wasn't bad at it, even. Not great, but not bad. I could have been a respected editor instead of a huge nerd. But all the editing in the world can't compare to building little websites and mangling text and writing things and messing around in spreadsheets and figuring out what's wrong with comments.  I wake up thinking about how all the pieces fit together and I want to do more of it and with lots of people. I plan to be scared and exhausted most of the time. So far that's working.</p>

        <div><h1>Scientists supersize quantum mechanics : Nature News</h1><div class="entry-content" readability="73">&#13;

        &#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p>A team of scientists has succeeded in putting an object large enough to be visible to the naked eye into a mixed quantum state of moving and not moving. </p>
         <p>Andrew Cleland at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his team cooled a tiny metal paddle until it reached its quantum mechanical 'ground state' — the lowest-energy state permitted by quantum mechanics. They then used the weird rules of quantum mechanics to simultaneously set the paddle moving while leaving it standing still. The experiment shows that the principles of quantum mechanics can apply to everyday objects as well as as atomic-scale particles.</p>
         <p>The work is simultaneously being published online today in  <span class="i">Nature </span> and presented today at the American Physical Society's meeting in Portland, Oregon<sup><a href="#B1">1</a></sup>. </p>
         <p>According to quantum theory, particles act as waves rather than point masses on very small scales. This has dozens of bizarre consequences: it is impossible to know a particle's exact position and velocity through space, yet it is possible for the same particle to be doing two contradictory things simultaneously. Through a phenomenon known as 'superposition' a particle can be moving and stationary at the same time — at least until an outside force acts on it. Then it instantly chooses one of the two contradictory positions.</p>
         <p>But although the rules of quantum mechanics seem to apply at small scales, nobody has seen evidence of them on a large scale, where outside influences can more easily destroy fragile quantum states. "No one has shown to date that if you take a big object, with trillions of atoms in it, that quantum mechanics applies to its motion," Cleland says. </p>
         <p>There is no obvious reason why the rules of quantum mechanics shouldn't apply to large objects. Erwin Schrödinger, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, was so disturbed by the possibility of quantum weirdness on the large scale that he proposed his famous 'Schrödinger's cat' thought experiment. A cat is placed in a box with a vial of cyanide and a radioactive source. If the source decays, it triggers a device that will break the vial, killing the cat. During the time the box is shut, Schrödinger argued, the cat is in a superposition of alive and dead — an absurdity as far as he was concerned. </p>  <h2 class="inlineheading"> Wonderful weirdness</h2><p> Cleland and his team took a more direct measure of quantum weirdness at the large scale. They began with a a tiny mechanical paddle, or 'quantum drum', around 30 micrometres long that vibrates when set in motion at a particular range of frequencies. Next they connected the paddle to a superconducting electrical circuit that obeyed the laws of quantum mechanics. They then cooled the system down to temperatures below one-tenth of a kelvin.</p>
         <p>At this temperature, the paddle slipped into its quantum mechanical ground state. Using the quantum circuit, Cleland and his team verified that the paddle had no vibrational energy whatsoever. They then used the circuit to give the paddle a push and saw it wiggle at a very specific energy.</p>
         <p>Next, the researchers put the quantum circuit into a superposition of 'push' and 'don't push', and connected it to the paddle. Through a series of careful measurements, they were able to show that the paddle was both vibrating and not vibrating simultaneously. </p>

         <p>"It's wonderful," says Hailin Wang, a physicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene who has been working on a rival technique for putting an oscillator into the ground state. The work shows that the laws of quantum mechanics hold up as expected on a large scale. "It's good for physics for sure," Wang says.</p>
         <p>So if trillions of atoms can be put into a quantum state, why don't we see double-decker buses simultaneously stopping and going? Cleland says he believes size does matter: the larger an object, the easier it is for outside forces to disrupt its quantum state.</p>
         <p>"The environment is this huge, complex thing," says Cleland. "It's that interaction with this incredibly complex system that makes the quantum coherence vanish."</p>
         <p>Still, he says, there's plenty of reasons to keep trying to get large objects into quantum states. Large quantum states could tell researchers more about the relationship between quantum mechanics and gravity — something that is not well understood. And quantum resonators could be useful for something, although Cleland admits he's not entirely sure what. "There might be some interesting application," he says. "But frankly, I don't have one now."<span class="end-of-item"> </span></p>&#13;

        <div><h1>Tweetage Wasteland : My Head is in the Cloud</h1><div class="entry" readability="68">&#13;
        			<p>Recently, our babysitter was struck by a car just a few steps from our front door. Luckily, none of her injuries were life threatening. Her cell phone, however, was brutalized beyond recognition.</p>
        <p>Before heading to the emergency room, I climbed into the back of the ambulance where I asked her if she wanted me to call her boyfriend. She said she did, but she didn’t know his telephone number. It was lost along with her now obliterated cell phone, and she had never committed the number to memory.</p>
        <p>At first, I was shocked. How could she possibly not know her own boyfriend’s telephone number? It must have been the trauma of being hit by a car. But then I thought about it for a few seconds, and I realized that – without pulling out my iPhone – I don’t know her telephone number either.</p>
        <p>I remember my friend Mordy’s numbers (both lines) from when we were eleven. But I can’t even tell you the first three digits of the most important telephone number of my adult life. For that matter, I have no idea what Mordy’s current number is …</p>
        <p>What’s the difference? Now my cell phone is programmed to remember this kind of data for me. My head was once filled with bits and pieces of information like phone numbers, to-do lists, and addresses. I’ve ceded that responsibility to technology.</p>
        <p>Last summer, I forgot my friend Norman’s birthday. We’ve known each other since elementary school. He has the same birthday as my mother-in-law. It’s an easy one. I’ve never missed his birthday. Until now.</p>
        <p>Norman is not a big web user and he’s not in my stream. Over the last couple years, I’ve gotten used to letting Facebook, Twitter and online calendars remind me of what I need to know. My reliance on that stream is starting to eat away at things that have been in my memory for decades.</p>
        <p>And the stream creates information equality where it shouldn’t exist. I post happy birthday messages to people I hardly know and then forget Norman’s altogether. When my brain was in charge, it used to make these kinds of value judgments. The stream doesn’t. It just runs and runs.</p>
        <p>My phone tells me numbers, Facebook reminds me of birthdays, my nav system gives me directions, Google tells me how to spell, my bookmarks remind me of what I’ve read, my inbox tells me who I’m having a conversation with – my mind has been distributed across several devices and services.</p>
        <p>My head is in the cloud.</p>
        <p>Now, after a few years of this, I realize that when I look up from the screen I know almost nothing. And maybe that would be fine if the absent phone numbers and upcoming dates were freeing space for deeper and more introspective thought. But I sense that my addiction to the realtime stream is only making room for the consumption of a faster stream.</p>
        <p>Norman, you need to join Facebook or I may never wish you a happy birthday again.</p>
        <p>Mordy, if I ever lose my cell phone, our connection will be lost forever – unless your family’s 1977 phone numbers are still forwarding to you.</p>
        <p>And just in case our babysitter ever has another emergency, I’ve programmed her boyfriend’s number along with 911 into my iPhone.</p>
        <p>To the rest of you, Happy Birthday. Hope I’m close.</p>

        Earlier this month, we saw the incredible <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/" target="_blank">Panic Status board</a>, a real-time visualization of the Portland-based software company's activities and tasks. Running on a large high def screen mounted in the office, the Web-based board tracks the number of outstanding tech requests, creating a way for everyone at the company to quickly see what's happening. Panic found that the board, in effect, motivated people to attack the support queue like a game, aiming to get the outstanding requests number down to zero.<p>
        Programmer and journalist Andy Baio, of Waxy.org and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://my.sxsw.com/events/event/516" target="_blank">spoke at SXSW</a> about games bleeding into real life, the workplace and the marketplace. Using games as psychological motivators isn't a far-fetched idea. Both the Ford Fusion and Honda Insight have dashboard graphics that show you how efficiently you're driving via growing leaves. The Obama team understood this and leveraged the power of a leader board and achievements during the presidential campaign. Nike realized this earlier with the hugely effective Nike+ where it used real world data and visualization to get people exercising, a notoriously difficult thing to get people to do regularly. Nike+ users can track their own performance, compare with friends, and even compete in virtual races and marathons.</p><div id="continued" readability="20"><br />
        The Guardian newspaper published over 700,000 pages of U.K. politician's expenses online, and was able to get 20,000 volunteers to sift through <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/06/four-crowdsourcing-lessons-from-the-guardians-spectacular-expenses-scandal-experiment/" target="_blank">the huge database of government paperwork</a> by adding a status bar and other game components. The achievements, incentives, and competition involved in these kinds of gameplay games can, as Baio describes, be incredible motivators to make the "not fun, fun." <p>
        Learning about Microsoft Office has even been turned into a game by the team at Office Labs. <a href="http://www.officelabs.com/ribbonhero" target="_blank">Ribbon Hero</a> takes these "bloated apps" and adds a scoreboard, rewarding you with points as you try new features and complete challenges. For example, learning to format a document with headers, alignment, and italics (a riveting activity) gets you points, which you can then share on Facebook and compare with friends. Adding feedback, recognition, goals, and a sense of community to these seemingly boring things, Baio explained, can be surprisingly effective in hacking your mind into making the activities seem attractive and exciting.</p><p>
        Even Target is getting in on adding game components to work. The company tested a simple <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dpstyles/4141140976/" target="_blank">cashier rating system</a>, which rated each individual check-out, letting cashiers get real feedback on their work. Baio highlighted Jesse Schell's excellent Dice presentation, '<a href="http://g4tv.com/videos/44277/dice-2010-design-outside-the-box-presentation/" target="_blank">Design Outside the Box</a>,' to explore where the combination of gaming and real life could go next. With the spread of mobile technology and always on Web, systems for tracking (and scoring) everything from exercising, brushing your teeth, getting to work on time, and shopping might not be that far off.<br /><em><br />

        <div><h1>Rational Irrationality: The Lehman Report: Is It Time for a Special Prosecutor? : The New Yorker</h1><div class="entry-content" readability="73">
         <p>After a slow start, commentators and media outlets are finally cottoning onto the implications of a devastating new report on the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Andrew Ross Sorkin, my fellow chronicler of the financial crisis and frequent co-panelist, has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/business/16sorkin.html" target="_blank">good column</a> in today’s <i>Times</i> which takes to task the regulators who ignored, or possibly even condoned, the accounting shenanigans that Lehman was getting up to during its final months. Meanwhile, Eliot Spitzer and Bill Black, two lawyers who know a lot about Wall Street wrongdoing, are <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=8954" target="_blank">calling on</a> Congress to launch its own inquiry into the matter. If I am right, this is only the beginning.</p>
        
        <p>Late last week, when Anton Valukas, a lawyer appointed by the U.S. bankruptcy court, released his twenty-two hundred page report, many U.S. media outlets underplayed it. (<i>The Financial Times</i>, displaying some Fleet Street nous, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2e412d50-2d6e-11df-a262-00144feabdc0.html" target="_blank">splashed the story</a> across its first three pages on Saturday.) The big news in the report, in case you missed it, is that Lehman, in the months before it went under, used accounting trickery to shift about fifty billion dollars off its balance sheet—an exercise that reduced the leverage ratios it reported, thereby misleading investors about its true financial condition. This finding, from Valukas, of the law firm Jenner &amp; Block, raises the possibility of civil charges, or even criminal charges, being filed against former senior executives of Lehman for accounting fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty. (Valukas said Lehman’s accounting was “materially misleading,” and he accused the firm of “actionable balance sheet manipulation.”)</p>
        
        <p>A lawyer for Richard Fuld, the former chairman of Lehman, has said Fuld knew nothing about any wrongdoing, and that was he ignorant of the specific transactions that Valukas criticizes, but that may not be enough to save him. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which was passed in the wake of the accounting scandals at Enron, Worldcom, and other big firms, the C.E.O. has to sign off on the company accounts, and he is personally liable for any finagling that may have taken place. An acrimonious legal battle beckons over whether the tactics that Lehman used were illegal, or merely dodgy. These tactics involved pretending to sell tens of billions of securities to other firms just before the accounting deadline, thereby bolstering the amount of cash the firm appeared to be holding, and then buying the assets immediately after the deadline. The U.K. law firm of Linklaters signed off on these sham transactions—several U.S. firms refused to do so, according to Valukas—and Ernst &amp; Young, Lehman’s accountant, didn’t raise any objections, either.</p>
        
        <p>All of this is fascinating, and it raises two questions that many Americans who don’t know much about Wall Street have been asking for the past couple of years: Bernie Madoff apart, why hasn’t anybody been sent to jail? And where were the regulators?</p> 
        
        
         <div id="entry-more" readability="69"><p>Until now, my answer to the first question has been that while much of what the bankers did was reprehensible, it was perfectly legal. I still think this is the case—in finance, it is often the case that the biggest scandal is what you can get away with within the law—but the Valukas report raises the possibility that I was wrong, and that the big Wall Street firms were engaged in Enron-style accounting fraud. Spitzer and Black, who are both associated with the Roosevelt Institute, have been arguing for months that accounting fraud, and other wrongdoing, was pervasive on Wall Street. “If we are to prevent another, potentially more devastating financial crisis, we must understand what happened and who knew what,” they write.”We must stop the three card monte accounting practices that create the potential and reality of fundamental misrepresentation.”</p>
        
        <p>The issue of what the regulators knew, or didn’t know, is equally explosive. Until  the beginning of 2008, Lehman was regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which adopted a notoriously lax attitude to Wall Street firms taking on crazy amounts of debt. But at the beginning of 2008, according to Valukas, the New York Federal Reserve stepped in, carrying out a series of stress tests designed to gauge Lehman’s ability to withstand negative shocks, three of which the firm failed. Despite these failures, Valukas notes: “[I]t does not appear any agency required any action of Lehman in response to the results of the stress testing.” The chairman of the New York Fed at the time was Timothy Geithner, the current Treasury Secretary. I have recently  written an article that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/15/100315fa_fact_cassidy">defended</a> Geithner’s financial stabilization plan, which he enacted after joining the Obama Administration. Still, I think Geithner’s role in regulating (or not regulating) Wall Street in the years prior to the sub-prime blowup is a matter of legitimate public interest, as is the role of Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, and the rest of the familiar crew.</p>
        
        <p> Of course, Congress has already appointed one body to look into what happened: the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which is chaired by Phil Angelides, a well-respected former state treasurer of California. The F.C.I.C. has been holding a series of hearings on Capitol Hill, and its <a href="http://www.fcic.gov/" target="_blank">Web site</a> is already stocked with interesting testimony. But the F.C.I.C.’s remit is a very broad one: “to investigate the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.” If the Angelides commission does its job properly, it could serve as a lesser equivalent of the 9/11 Commission, providing a valuable overview of what happened and how policymakers erred, together with some broad policy guidance about what changes are necessary to prevent a recurrence.</p>
        
        <p>That is all well and good. But what the public is also demanding, and what may well be justified on the basis of the Valukas report, is the appointment of a body with police powers which can cross-examine Wall Street bigwigs under oath and determine what laws, if any, have been broken. As a practical matter, there is no reason why such an investigation couldn’t be carried out by career prosecutors at the Justice Department, working in tandem with the F.B.I. and the enforcement division of the S.E.C. By launching such an inquiry and sending out some subpoenas, the Obama Administration could signal to the public that it is serious about pursuing Wall Street wrongdoing, but also that it is intends to respect the law. If the investigators, after carrying out a proper inquiry, conclude that the behavior of Fuld and other Wall Street bigwigs fell short of illegal behavior, they could come out and say so.</p>
        
        <p>An alternative, and probably less wise, course of action would be to appoint a special prosecutor to probe Wall Street wrongdoing. From Whitewater to Scootergate, we have witnessed a series of these investigations degenerate into fishing expeditions, with the original reason for setting them up getting lost. Having spent large sums of money and seen themselves written up in the newspapers, the independent prosecutors become loath to fold their tents without at least one headline-grabbing finding. Unless somebody comes up with a credible reason why the Justice Department can’t be trusted to do the job by itself, I think the best course of action would be to launch a normal federal investigation under a veteran government prosecutor and see where, if anywhere, it leads. Anything less would insult the public and leave the Administration open to the charge that it is pursuing white-collar crime less vigorously than the Bush Administration, which, for all its sins, did aggressively go after Ken Lay, Bernie Ebbers, Dennis Kozlowski, and other rogue C.E.O.s.</p>

        <div><h1>The History of the Honey Trap – By Phillip Knightley | Foreign Policy</h1><div class="content" readability="156">
            <p>
        MI5 is worried about sex. In a 14-page document distributed last year to
        hundreds of British banks, businesses, and financial institutions, titled "The
        Threat from Chinese Espionage," the famed British security service  described
        a wide-ranging Chinese effort to blackmail Western businesspeople over sexual
        relationships. The document, as the London <i>Times
        </i><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7009749.ece">reported</a>
        in January, explicitly warns that Chinese intelligence services are trying to cultivate
        "long-term relationships" and have been known to "exploit
        vulnerabilities such as sexual relationships ... to pressurise individuals to
        co-operate with them."

        <p>
        This
        latest report on Chinese corporate espionage tactics is only the most recent installment
        in a long and sordid history of spies and sex. For millennia, spymasters of all
        sorts have trained their spies to use the amorous arts to obtain secret
        information.
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        trade name for this type of spying is the "honey trap." And it turns
        out that both men and women are equally adept at setting one -- and equally
        vulnerable to tumbling in. Spies use sex, intelligence, and the thrill of a
        secret life as bait. Cleverness, training, character, and patriotism are often
        no defense against a well-set honey trap. And as in normal life, no planning
        can take into account that a romance begun in deceit might actually turn into a
        genuine, passionate affair. In fact, when an East German honey trap was exposed
        in 1997, one of the women involved refused to believe she had been deceived,
        even when presented with the evidence. "No, that's not true," she insisted.
        "He really loved me." 
        </p>
        <p>
        Those
        who aim to perfect the art of the honey trap in the future, as well as those
        who seek to insulate themselves, would do well to learn from honey trap
        history. Of course, there are far too many stories -- too many dramas, too many
        rumpled bedsheets, rattled spouses, purloined letters, and ruined lives -- to
        do that history justice here. Yet one could begin with five famous stories and
        the lessons they offer for honey-trappers, and honey-trappees, everywhere.

        <b>1. Don't Follow That Girl</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        In
        1986, <a href="http://www.serve.com/vanunu/">Mordechai Vanunu</a>, an Israeli
        technician who had worked in Israel's Dimona nuclear facility, went to the
        British newspapers with his claim that Israel had developed atomic bombs. His
        statement was starkly at odds with Israel's official policy of nuclear
        ambiguity -- and he had photos to prove it. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        period of negotiation among the newspapers was tense, and at one point the
        London <i>Sunday Times</i> was keeping
        Vanunu hidden in a secret location in suburban London while it attempted to
        verify <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article830147.ece">his story</a>.
        But Vanunu got restless. He announced to his minders at the paper that he had
        met a young woman while visiting tourist attractions in London and that they
        were planning a romantic weekend in Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        newspaper felt it had no right to prevent Vanunu from leaving. It was a huge
        mistake: Soon after arriving in Rome with his lady friend, Vanunu was seized by
        Mossad officers, forcibly drugged, and smuggled out of Italy by ship to Israel,
        where he was eventually put on trial for treason. Vanunu served 18 years in
        jail, 11 years of it in solitary confinement. Released in 2004, he is still
        confined to Israel under tight restrictions, which include not being allowed to
        meet with foreigners or talk about his experiences. Britain has never held an
        inquiry into the affair. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        woman who set the honey trap was a Mossad officer, Cheryl Ben Tov, code-named "Cindy."
        Born in Orlando, Fla., she was married to an officer of the Israeli security
        service. After the operation, she was given a new identity to prevent reprisals,
        and eventually she left Israel to return to the United States. But her role in
        the Vanunu affair was vital. The Mossad could not have risked a diplomatic
        incident by kidnapping Vanunu from British soil, so he had to be lured abroad --
        an audacious undertaking, but in this case a successful one.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>2. Take Favors from No One</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        One
        of the best-known honey traps in spy history involves Mata Hari, a Dutch woman
        who had spent some years as an erotic dancer in Java. (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1919260672/tt0023196" target="_blank">Greta Garbo</a> played her in a famous 1931 film.) During World War I, the
        French arrested her on charges of spying for the Germans, based on their
        discovery through intercepted telegrams that the German military attaché in
        Spain was sending her money. The French claimed that the German was her control
        officer and she was passing French secrets to him, secrets she had obtained by seducing
        prominent French politicians and officers. 
        </p>
        <p>
        During
        the trial, Mata Hari defended herself vigorously, claiming that she was the
        attaché's mistress and he was sending her gifts. But
        her arguments did not convince her judges. She died by firing squad on Oct. 15,
        1917, refusing a blindfold. 
        </p>
        <p>
        After
        the war, the French admitted that they had no real evidence against her. The
        conclusion by most <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-474631/Mata-Hari-interested-thing--wasnt-espionage.html">modern
        historians</a> has been that she was shot not because she was running a honey
        trap operation, but to send a powerful message to any women who might be tempted
        to follow her example. The lesson here, perhaps, is that resembling a honey
        trap can be as dangerous as actually being one.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>3. Beware the Media</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Sometimes
        a country's entire journalism corps can fall into an apparent honey trap. Yevgeny
        Ivanov was a Soviet attaché in London in the early 1960s. He was a handsome,
        personable officer and a popular figure on the British diplomatic and social
        scene, a frequent guest at parties given by society osteopath Stephen Ward. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Ward
        was famous for inviting the pick of London's beautiful young women to his
        gatherings. One of them was Christine Keeler, a scatterbrained '60s "good-time
        girl" who supposedly became Ivanov's mistress. Unfortunately for everyone
        involved, Keeler was the lover of the married British MP and Secretary of State
        for War John Profumo, who was then working on plans with the United States to
        station cruise missiles in Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
        In
        1963, Profumo's affair with Keeler was exposed in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/apr/10/past.derekbrown">the press</a>.
        Britain's famed scandal sheets also blew up the Soviet spy/honey trap angle,
        for which there was no evidence. Profumo was forced to resign for lying about
        the affair to the House of Commons. His wife forgave him, but his career was
        ruined. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Ivanov
        was recalled to Moscow, where he lived out his days pouring ridicule on the
        whole story: "It is ludicrous to think that Christine Keeler could have
        said to John Profumo in bed one night, 'Oh, by the way, darling, when are the cruise
        missiles going to arrive in Germany?'" He was probably right: When the
        media gets hold of a potential honey trap, the truth is easily lost.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>4. The Deadliest of Honey Traps</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Not
        all honey traps are heterosexual ones. In fact, during less tolerant eras, a
        homosexual honey trap with a goal of blackmail could be just as effective as
        using women as bait. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Take
        the tragic story of Jeremy Wolfenden, the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i>'s correspondent in Moscow in the early 1960s.
        Wolfenden was doubly vulnerable to KGB infiltration: He spoke Russian, and he
        was gay. Seizing its opportunity, the KGB ordered the Ministry of Foreign Trade's
        barber to seduce him and put a man with a camera in Wolfenden's closet to take
        compromising photos. The KGB then blackmailed Wolfenden, threatening to pass on
        the photographs to his employer if he did not spy on the Western community in
        Moscow.
        </p>
        <p>
        Wolfenden
        reported the incident to his embassy, but the official British reaction was not
        what he expected. On his next visit to London, he was called to see an officer
        from the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) who asked him to work as a double
        agent, leading the KGB along but continuing to report back to SIS. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        stress led Wolfenden into alcoholism. He tried to end his career as a spy, marrying
        a British woman he had met in Moscow, arranging a transfer from Moscow to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>'s Washington bureau, and
        telling friends he had put his espionage days behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
        But the
        spy life was not so easily left behind. After encountering his old SIS handler
        at a British Embassy party in Washington in 1965, Wolfenden was again pulled
        back into the association. His life fell into a blur of drunkenness. On Dec. 28,
        1965, when he was 31, he died, apparently from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by
        a fall in the bathroom. His friends believed, no matter what the actual cause
        of death, that between them, the KGB and the SIS had sapped his will to live. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Ironically,
        his time as a spy probably produced little useful material for either side. His
        colleagues weren't giving him any information because they were warned that he
        was talking to the KGB, and the Soviets weren't likely to give him anything
        either. In this case, the honey pot proved deadly -- with little purpose for
        anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>5. All the Single Ladies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        broadest honey trap in intelligence history was probably the creation of the
        notorious East German spymaster, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/nov/10/germany.mainsection">Markus
        Wolf</a>. In the early 1950s, Wolf recognized that, with marriageable German
        men killed in large numbers during World War II and more and more German women
        turning to careers, the higher echelons of German government, commerce, and
        industry were now stocked with lonely single women, ripe -- in his mind -- for
        the temptations of a honey trap. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Wolf
        set up a special department of the Stasi, East Germany's security service, and
        staffed it with his most handsome, intelligent officers. He called them "Romeo
        spies." Their assignment was to infiltrate West Germany, seek out
        powerful, unmarried women, romance them, and squeeze from them all their
        secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thanks
        to the Romeo spies and their honey traps, the Stasi penetrated most levels of
        the West German government and industry. At one stage, the East Germans even
        had a spy inside NATO who was able to give information on the West's deployment
        of nuclear weapons. Another used her<b> </b>connections
        to become a secretary in the office of the West German chancellor, Helmut
        Schmidt. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The
        scheme lost its usefulness when the West German counterintelligence authorities
        devised a simple way of identifying the Stasi officers as soon as they arrived
        in West Germany: They sported distinctly different haircuts -- the practical "short
        back and sides" variety instead of the fashionable, elaborate West German
        style. Alerted by train guards, counterintelligence officers would follow the
        Romeo spies and arrest them at their first wrong move.
        </p>
        <p>
        Three
        of the women were caught and tried, but in general the punishment was lenient. One
        woman who managed to penetrate West German intelligence was sentenced to only
        six and a half years in prison, probably because ordinary West Germans had some
        sympathy with the women. Wolf himself faced trial twice after the collapse of communism
        but received only a two-year suspended sentence, given the confusion of whether
        an East German citizen could be guilty of treachery to West Germany. 
        </p>
        <p>
         
        </p>
        <p>
        Unlike
        most spymasters, Wolf preserved his own thoughts on his experience for
        posterity in his autobiography, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891620126?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fopo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1891620126">Man
        Without a Face</a></i>. Wolf <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJfkgIsmrU8C&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;ots=5Z9qdRipJj&amp;dq=%22They%20were%20sharp%20operators%20who%20realized%20that%20a%20lot%20can%20be%20done%20with%20sex%22&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=%22They%20were%20sharp%20operators%20who%20realized%20that">denied</a>
        that he put pressure on his officers to use <i>die
        Liebe</i> to do their jobs; it was up to the officers themselves: "They
        were sharp operators who realized that a lot can be done with sex. This is true
        in business and espionage because it opens up channels of communication more
        quickly than other approaches."
        </p>
        <p>
        How
        about the morality of it all? Wolf replied for all spymasters when he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BJfkgIsmrU8C&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;ots=5Z9qdRjgJo&amp;dq=%22As%20long%20as%20there%20is%20espionage%2C%20there%20will%20be%20Romeos%20seducing%20unsuspecting%22&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q=%22As%20long%20as%20there%20is%20espionage,%20there%20wil">wrote</a>,
        "As long as there is espionage, there will be Romeos seducing unsuspecting
        [targets] with access to secrets." Yet he maintains: "I was running
        an intelligence service, not a lonely-hearts club."

        <p>You: “Sure! No problem! I’ll make it more delightful!”</p>

        <p>Do yourself and your client a big favor and make it very clear she needs to provide feedback now (remember, do so nicely!) or forever hold her peace. </p>
        <p>Say something like, “I’m so tickled pink you went through ALL the content and you don’t haveANYrevisions. I’ll go ahead and send you the invoice and close out your project. It was great working with you!”</p></div>
        
        <div readability="5">If she responds with, “Wait! Wait! I might still have some revisions!” you can firmly (but nicely!) remind her of the feedback process you agreed to when the project kicked off. <b><br /></b><br />
        Tip: Include one or two questions using the comments feature in your document when you send it to the client. That way, if she gives you the ‘ol, “Looks great!” you can respond by asking if she had any further thoughts about your questions. 
        <p>If she has no idea what you’re talking about, or if she responds with, “Oh, right. We’re going to have to change that,” you know she didn’t look it over thoroughly. Proceed with caution!</p></div>

Until you get your document back from your client and see she added ‘managers’ to the company tagline, home page headline, global navigation, footer, and image ALT tags.  
        <p>Clearly, you need to clarify what your client wants. <b></b></p>
        <p>But, for the sake of your working relationship, you also need to be careful not to put her on the defensive or make her feel foolish. There are many ways to proceed. For instance, you could say …  </p>
        <p>“Earlier you said I shouldn’t call you ‘managers.’ But throughout the document you inserted the word ‘managers.’ What exactly would you like me to do?”<b></b></p>
        <p>There’s nothing <i>wrong </i>with that approach. I guess. But doesn’t this just seem friendlier … </p>
        <p>“Hey! Thanks for the feedback. I had one quick question regarding the word ‘managers.’ I see you’ve added it in a few places—is it okay to use that term now? Thanks!”</p>
        <p>See? Nicer. Generally, clients like it when you’re nice to them.</p></div>
        
        <div readability="27">
        <p><b>4. Nonsensical feedback.  <br /></b>Maybe she’s high on coffee. Or she prefers expressing thoughts verbally. Or maybe she’s been up all night watching <i>Lethal Weapon</i> and its sequels. Whatever the reason, sometimes your client will give feedback that, well, makes absolutely no sense. </p>
        <p>“Could you please add another future verb to this entire beginning of copy paragraph? Thanks!” </p>
        <p>Huh?</p>
        <p>“I talked to Janice and she said Tom’s player copy doesn’t need any more action-oriented dropdowns (except maybe for twice?). Thanks!!”</p>
        <p>Whazza who? </p>
        <p>“Legal review. Stakeholders. Danny Glover. Thanks!!!” </p>
        <p>Mmm.  <br /><b><br /></b>If you have no clue in sweet heaven what she’s talking about (it does happen), schedule an in-person interview with her—over the phone works, too—so you can walk through her, um, “points.” <b><br /></b><br />
        Start by reading a couple of her comments back to her. Hopefully, she’ll stop you after a couple minutes and say, “Geez. I wasn’t making any sense! I meant to say blah, blah, blah.” Or whatever. If she doesn’t, hopefully you’ll be able to glean some insight into her state of mind through verbal cues. </p>
        <p><b>Finally, a request.</b> </p>
        <p>It’s easy to roll your eyes when a client gives you slick, vague, contradictory, nonsensical feedback. But you know what? She’s likely juggling a billion things, from wireframes to babies to <i>Lethal Weapon</i> DVDs. Your copy is just one of them. Cut her some slack. And remember, she’s not a writer. If she were, she wouldn’t need you.</p>

        <p>
        To this point, <em>Sleep is Death</em> might seem so far, so dungeon-master, and any seasoned tabletop champ might instantly recognize the free-jazz / free-reign excitement of riffing off a friend, of having every boundary you've carefully constructed playfully and mischievously pushed and tested.
        
        </p><p> What's different here is that you're given a standard set of digital tools to create with, and a 30 second time limit that enforces a tighter scale and scope. 
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        
        
        Again, that's by deliberate design, and it's not coincidentally inspired by Chris Crawford, a true videogame veteran who's been struggling to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/storytron-s-crawford-screw-graphics-create-better-emotions">create the capacity for more meaningful in-game interactions</a> for decades, and who spent a long night just over one year ago to the day in<a href="http://www.offworld.com/2009/07/video-jason-rohrer-chris-crawf.html"> conversation with Rohrer on just that subject</a>. The difference is that where Crawford has taken nearly 20 years to get to the first release of a complex computer-parsable conversation structure with <a href="http://www.storytron.com/">Storytron</a>, Rohrer forgoes the problem of constructing a believable artificial intelligence by replacing it with a genuine one.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        That doesn't mean that <em>Sleep</em> limits or restricts your imagination: with editors for scenes, music scores, and sprites (placed in a searchable database with every object you've created or downloaded from another player), your stories are only as literal or abstract as you'd like, or as your player demands. In anyone else's hands, my story of mid-life on-camera ennui could have just as easily been about a sperm cell's journey to an egg, a dog's life, an orc's quest, the tragedy of an 18th century pearl diver or a hazy pink pixel field's conversational intermingling with a bright blue trapezoid, provided both parties can keep the illusion alive. 
        
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
        And that, ultimately, will be <em>Sleep is Death</em>'s true test on its April release. Most of us consume media because we've lost the capacity, interest or time to construct thrilling tales of our own, and it's unproven how much an easily grasped set of pared down tools can inspire — whether they'll turn even a few of us into budding Rohrer's or whether we still need him to entertain us. 
        
        </p><p>
        But I will say that — even having only played music as a 'band' less than a handful of times — there's a real and comparable magic to exploring 'possibility spaces' in an intimate setting, especially under pressure. <em><a href="http://www.sleepisdeath.net/">Sleep is Death</a></em> is the best tool I've witnessed to make that magic more accessible to everyone.

We said we were <a href="http://gawker.com/5431331/who-is-the-hipster-of-the-decade">going to ban</a> the god damn word "hipster," but we have <a href="http://gawker.com/5494769/if-only-fake-issues-could-solve-our-real-problems">lapsed</a>. <em>Mea culpa</em>, and shit. The real problem is that there's not a pithy replacement word. That's where you come in.</p>
        <p>In the same way that we used futuristic internet <a href="http://gawker.com/5016785/we-must-have-a-better-slur-for-white-people">"crowdsourcing" technology</a> to come up with the <a href="http://gawker.com/5018078/shut-up-nilla">white-person slur "Nilla</a>" (which is, um, in widespread use, now), we are going to allow you, the asshole commentariat, to come up with an official replacement word for "Hipster." We know you're all hipsters, so it should be easy. Your new word should meet these criteria, which I'm just spitballing:</p>
        <p>1. It must succeed in evoking a widely understood and recognized subculture. The same subculture now referred to as "hipster."<br />
        2. It must be one word. Pithiness is key. The point is to be able to <em>refer</em> to hipsters without having to <em>describe</em> them, which is impossible.<br />
        3. "Hipster" is, in essence, a slur. It must have at least an underlying whiff of insult.</p>
        <p>Okay then! Put your suggestions in the comments. Then we'll pick the best ones, put out a poll, and before you know one more annoying slang word will have entered the English language.<br />

        <div><h1>The Pavement reunion and the end of baby boomer cultural hegemony. - By Zach Baron - Slate Magazine&#13;
                </h1><div id="article_body" readability="116"><p><strong><em>Also in Slate, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2248157/">Troy Patterson reviews Quarantine the Past, the new Pavement compilation</a>.</em></strong></p><p><span class="imagewrapper"><img src="http://img.slate.com/media/1/123125/123050/2240796/2246626/100318_CB_PavementTN.jpg" alt="Pavement in Sibuya,Tokyo" height="195" width="252" /><label class="caption">Pavement in Sibuya, Tokyo</label></span>Five years ago, Jack Shafer wrote <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2130429/">an essay</a> in these pages asking a mischievous question: How will we know when baby boomers have lost control of American popular culture? "Sooner or later," Shafer predicted, "the post-boomers will give them the necessary nudge, push, and shove to sweep their rotting culture from the scene, and references to Beatles tracks will become as irrelevant as references to Mills Brothers songs." The question was, when? "What post-boomer reference in a mass-media headline or TV commercial will signal the cultural coup?" </p><p>Well, how about this one? "<a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201003/pavement-indie" target="_blank">Greatest. Indie-est. Band. Ever.</a>" The headline belongs to the latest issue of <em>GQ</em>, with apologies to <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FThe-Simpsons%2FB001CFJ4O0%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dep%5Fsprkl%5Ftv%5FB001CFJ4O0&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">The Simpsons</a></em>' Comic Book Guy. ("<em>The Simpsons</em><strong> </strong>should produce a heap of references in headlines, movies, music, and ads," Shafer foretold.) The band in question is Pavement—"the finest rock band of the '90s," <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bVUQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3I8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5601%2C2549471" target="_blank">according to</a> the dean of American rock critics, Robert Christgau—who are reuniting this month for the first time since their 1999 breakup. <em>GQ</em> had the sensible idea of sending go-to generational representative Chuck Klosterman out to Portland, Ore., to ask Stephen Malkmus, the band's famously unforthcoming front man, a basic and essential question: why? Malkmus stops and starts a couple times, and then answers in the way that anyone who followed Pavement in the '90s knew he would. "Will it be fun for us? Will the people in the audience have fun? Who knows?" Malkmus told the reporter who was there, ostensibly, to help him promote the band's high-stakes reunion tour. "It's not like I'm gagging to get out there and play those songs." </p><p>This isn't what you'd expect to hear from an older band like the Rolling Stones, embarking on their umpteenth stadium-based cash bonanza. But from Malkmus this is about right. Pavement's indifference to fame, fortune, and fidelity (of both the sonic and interpersonal varieties; just ask Malkmus' band mates about the latter) is the thing for which they were most loved during their initial run. Malkmus, surveying the cultural landscape a decade later, can be sure that his unchanged attitude won't be lost on the ticket-buying public. Indeed, demand for the reunion was so strong that the first four shows the band announced for New York City sold out a full year in advance. It's a Pavement kind of world now. </p><p>To wit: In January, the politely spoken New York indie-rock band Vampire Weekend <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/vampire-weekend-lands-first-no-1-album-1004060383.story#/news/vampire-weekend-lands-first-no-1-album-1004060383.story" target="_blank">debuted at No. 1</a> on the <em>Billboard</em> charts, selling 124,000 copies of their sophomore record <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contra-Vampire-Weekend/dp/B002JN74WI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1268924229&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Contra</a></em> and beating out everyone from the pop star Ke$ha to the boomer-goddess Susan Boyle to become, momentarily anyway, the most popular act in the country. Two weeks later, while echt-boomer act the Who got the Super Bowl XLIV halftime nod, the estimated 153 million people who tuned in to watch the game were also treated to repeated doses of "Wake Up," the yelpy 2004 anthem from Canadian indie darlings the Arcade Fire, which the NFL <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUV4YKbiVxQ" target="_blank">had licensed for the evening</a>. (The band, in true indie fashion, donated the money to Haiti.) Volkswagen followed the NFL's lead, paying old-school music icon Stevie Wonder to act in the premiere of their minute-long <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ3wgX2Oruo" target="_blank">"Punch Dub" spot</a>, even as they handed over the soundtrack to the Brooklyn indie artists Grizzly Bear. All of these relatively new artists can claim a pretty direct lineage back to Pavement, and the music they make tends to appeal to teenagers from not just this past decade, but the aging ones from the prior two decades as well. The scale and reach may be new, but the sound is not, particularly. </p><a name="page_start" id="page_start"></a><a name="p2" id="p2"></a><p>Nor, of course, is the phenomena of indie-rock showing up in commercials, or on screens in general. Cadillac has used the in-demand sounds of both the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXryKQxqmME" target="_blank">electro house duo Justice</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CasjUOwkdI" target="_blank">peppy French band Phoenix</a> in advertisements over the last couple years. Indie acts like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0rx1srLsh0" target="_blank">Matt &amp; Kim</a> and <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1543292789?bctid=22470081001" target="_blank">the Dodos</a> have helped shill for various beer and liquor companies. The recent films <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JN74WI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JN74WI" target="_blank"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104W8T6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00104W8T6" target="_blank">Juno</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BAODSC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002BAODSC" target="_blank">(500) Days of Summer</a>—</em>to name just a few—all employed indie songs to help convey a certain kind of emotional vulnerability and shyness; <em>Juno</em> went so far as to make New York proto-indie duo the Moldy Peaches' "Anyone Else but You" a minor plot point. Even the tween-targeted <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV56?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001OQCV56" target="_blank">Twilight: New Moon</a></em> looked to the indie world—as opposed to, say, the Jonas Brothers—for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13626-the-twilight-saga-new-moon-ost/" target="_blank">soundtrack help</a> last year. </p><p>What <em>is</em> new, however, is the breadth of post-boomer music knowledge advertisers, network executives, and other cultural apparatchiks seem to be increasingly confident they can expect from a 2010 audience. Last month, for instance, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> broadcast a skit involving the supposed reunion at a wedding reception of an '80s hard-core band named Crisis of Conformity. </p><p><!--Gutenberg HTML insert--></p><center></center><!--End Gutenberg HTML insert--><p>Nearly all the comic details of the sketch, from the name of the wedding party—"Cadena–Norton," an homage to two hard-core stalwarts, Black Flag's Dez Cadena and Hüsker Dü's Greg Norton—to the year the band had supposedly broken up (that'd be 1983, the same year Minor Threat disbanded) were inside jokes about a type of music that, until very recently, <em>SNL</em> couldn't have counted on its audience to know much about. Not anymore. In a world in which the underappreciated '90s alt-rock band Jawbox can <a href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2009/12/jawbox-reunion-savory/" target="_blank">reunite</a> to widespread acclaim on national television, courtesy of <em>Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, </em>cultural phenomena that were once beloved only by the young and hip are now being treated in the media more or less like culture, period. It's impossible to imagine a network taking a chance on Jimmy Fallon's house band, the Philadelphia-based and fiercely independent rap group the Roots, even five years ago; today, they're the most critically beloved band on late night.</p><p>Which is to say that these days, indie rock looks a lot like rock music, without the modifier. There are very few successful young bands today that don't play some variant or descendent of indie rock. And the alternative musical culture that spent most of the '80s and '90s as the exclusive property of college students, critics, and independent labels is now a fairly uncontroversial, major component of pop music in general. As Scott Plagenhoef, editor of the tastemaker Web site Pitchfork Media recently wrote in response to charges that his site's 2009 <a href="http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?showall=true&amp;bookmarkedmessageid=1287810&amp;boardid=41&amp;threadid=76656" target="_blank">year-end list</a> had a disproportionate indie bias, "This is what rock music made by and for adults looks and sounds like now." Pitchfork itself, once a punch line about the insularity and wonky isolation of indie-rock fans, is now among the most influential music publications on the planet. It's a measure of the newfound clout of both entities that one of Pavement's reunion tour stops will be the Web site's annual festival in Chicago this summer.</p><p>"It's such an icky boomer-like exercise, obsessing over your own demise," a pal told Shafer back in 2005, when he surveyed some of his younger friends about the potential signs of a coming cultural rebellion. True. And boomer self-satisfaction is such that we will probably have to pry the mic stand out of Mick Jagger's sinewy, scarf-draped hands before passing it to a younger generation. That is, if we even want to—because if the signature move of the baby boomer is obsessing over his own demise, then the signature move of the post-boomer is the capacity to be puzzled at our own success. The slacker indifference to accomplishment for which Pavement were beloved, and after which countless successor bands (and fans) modeled themselves, does not make for easy triumphalism. Winning, in this equation, can often look a lot like losing. Hence the generational agony of an article like the one that covered the proudly indie <em>Paste</em> in February: "<a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/01/is-indie-dead.html" target="_blank">Is Indie Dead?</a>"</p><p>Well, yes, probably, in the sense that the music featured in commercials and in gaudy, months-long reunion tours isn't recognizably the same as what it began life as. (Neither, of course, is "Satisfaction.") But indie-rock fans shouldn't act so surprised that their music is in ascendance. People who were into punk rock in 1980 or Pavement in 1993 are all old enough to be pushing the cultural buttons now—working at newspapers, writing for TV, booking musical guests, A&amp;Ring at labels, and, ahem, writing pieces like this one for national magazines. We were bound to knock boomers and their culture off at some point.

        <div><h1>tecosystems » Why I Am Against Software Patents</h1><div class="entry-content" readability="76">&#13;
        
        <p>The surprise to most people isn’t that I do not believe that software should be patentable. Given my long term interest in and coverage of free and open source software, I’m supposed to be at least mildly anti-establishment. It is also statistically unlikely that I would be in favor of patents, because industry sentiment is overwhelmingly against them at the present time (as the author acknowledges <a href="http://entrepreneur.venturebeat.com/2010/03/04/in-favor-of-software-patents/">here</a>).</p>
        <p>Most expect me to argue, as has <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2010/02/sawyer-weighs-in-on-intellectual-ventures.html">Brad Feld’s anonymous lawyer</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/08/11/080811ta_talk_surowiecki">James Surowiecki</a> or <a href="http://bx.businessweek.com/open-source-software/view?url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/10/red-hat-bilski-brief-says-software-patents-stifle-innovation.ars">Red Hat</a>, that patents are actually counterproductive with respect to innovation. That the entire purpose of a patent – to stimulate invention by granting the inventor wide-reaching protections – is subverted as broad, over-reaching patents are accumulated like mercury by competing organizations that are unwilling, unable or both to work together to advance markets. But while I agree with the sentiment, that’s not why I am against software patents. </p>
        <p>Others expect me to assert, as <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2010/02/software-patents-are-the-problem-not-the-answer.php">did</a> Union Square Ventures’ Brad Burnham, that software is, by its nature, different from physical inventions and innovations. That it does not require the same protections to stimulate invention that physical goods do. But while I believe this to be true, this is not why I’m against software patents. </p>
        <p>Others expect me to argue that, as Stephan Kinsella <a href="http://mises.org/daily/4018">has</a>, that patents are part of a system that is a net drain on the global economy ($31B, by his estimate). This is not why I’m against software patents. </p>
        <p>Still others expect me to argue that the greater good – a dangerous phrase if ever there was one – demands that software be unpatentable. That Nathan Myhrvold’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/technology/18patent.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Nathan%20Myhrvold&amp;st=cse">Intellectual Ventures</a> is the epitome of evil in the world, with a revenue model based strictly on extracting value from an antiquated patent system that has been mistakenly applied to an industry that requires no such protections. But while I personally believe that Myhrvold’s company is based entirely on extracting profit from a broken system rather stimulating invention as he claims – that Intellectual Ventures is just a version of those infomercials seeking ignorant “inventors” to exploit writ large – this isn’t why I’m against software patents. </p>
        <p>One last group expects me to contend that those in favor of more limited patent grants, such as FairSoftware’s <a href="http://entrepreneur.venturebeat.com/2010/03/04/in-favor-of-software-patents/">Alain Ranaud</a>, are failing to acknowledge – deliberately or otherwise – the speed of the software industry for which anything measured in years is an eternity. But though it is true that even a two year limit, let alone Ranaud’s proposed seven, is a lifetime in this business, that isn’t why I’m against software patents. </p>
        <p>The reason I am against software patents is, by contrast, very simple. It’s not rooted in philosophy, it doesn’t involve theories of good or evil; it’s not even about debating what is likely to spur more or less innovation. </p>
        <p>I am against software patents because it is not reasonable to expect that the current patent system, nor even one designed to improve or replace it, will ever be able to accurately determine what might be considered legitimately patentable from the overwhelming volume of innovations in software. Even the most trivial of software applications involves hundreds, potentially thousands of design decisions which might be considered by those aggressively seeking patents as potentially protectable inventions. If even the most <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html">basic</a> <a href="http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/03/amazons_1-click_patent_confirmed_following_re-exam.html">elements</a> of these are patentable, as they are currently, the patent system will be fundamentally unable to scale to meet that demand. As it is today. </p>
        <p>In addition to questions of volume are issues of expertise; for some of the proposed inventions, there may only be a handful of people in the world qualified to actually make a judgment on whether a development is sufficiently innovative so as to justify a patent. None of those people, presumably, will be employed by the patent office. Nor are the incentives for <a href="http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/2010/02/prior-art.html">fact witnesses</a> remotely sufficient. Nor will two developers always come to the same conclusions as to the degree to which a given invention is unique. </p>
        <p>I have no relevant expertise in other physical or science industries, and as such I have no educated opinion on whether innovations there should or should not be patentable. I can however state with confidence that the patent system as applied to software today does not work, nor is there is any reasonable expectation that it will or could in future. </p>
        <p>If we acknowledge that this is the case, which I believe one must if the available evidence is considered, then it is no longer possible – whatever your philosophical viewpoint – to be in favor of software patents. </p>

        <div><h1> Don’t be sexist, girls. Men’s books are grim, too - Times Online </h1><div id="related-article-links" readability="93">
        <!-- Pagination -->
        <p>First of all, ladies, may I apologise for interrupting? I know perfectly well that I am not welcome in discussions of the Orange Prize because it’s your special award for books by ladies about ladies for ladies. Although I suspect some of them are about gentlemen, too (because I know that although you pretend not to be, really you are fascinated by us). But I can’t be sure, because I am a chap, and so I am not allowed to read your books, or write them, certainly not judge them. Or even use them to kill spiders that you want removed from the bath but don’t want to see killed, so will I please just pick it up carefully without hurting it — careful of its leg! — and put it in the garden, now, now, eeeek, now!</p>
        <p>And I certainly know that you don’t want my opinion on the bumstorm kicked up this week by Daisy Goodwin, chair of the Orange Prize judges, when she said that . . . wait. Hang on. “Chair of the Orange Prize judges.” I can’t just let that go — even though to rail at post-feminist gender non-specific nomenclature is the oldest hat in the book (not a man’s trilby or a ladies pillbox but something unisex, such as a stupid Tibetan bobble hat).</p>
        <p>I know “chair” is what the Orange Prize people call her, but I have known Daisy Goodwin for years. I have worked with her. Clinked ’poo glasses at her table at The Ivy. And I can state categorically that she is not a chair.</p>
        <p>Daisy is a woman. I’m not afraid to say it. In fact, that’s how she got the job (men being, for the reasons contained above, not eligible). But for some reason, out there in the mimsy world of committee meetings and panel-chairing, some horrendous ball-cutting-off has gone on where we have to pretend that women are, in fact, chairs. Men can be chairmen. That’s all butch and macho and cool; a chairman is like a horseman.</p>
        <!--#include file="m63-article-related-attachements.html"--> 
        <!-- BEGIN: Module - M63 - Article Related Attachements -->
        <!-- BEGIN: Comment Teaser Module -->
        <!-- END: Module - M63 - Article Related Attachements -->
        <p>He really rides that chair. He masters the sonofabitch and he bends it to his will. Who wouldn’t want to be a chairman?</p>
        <p>But who wants to be a chair? As if you can take “man” off and somehow it still means the same thing. That’s not how words work (the Queen is said to be a fine horsewoman, not a fine horse). You take “man” off and you get a chair. You are saying that Daisy is the thing that is sat on, rather than she who does the sitting. “Hi, I’m Daisy. I’m a chair. Come, rest your weary arse on me.” I’m all for linguistic gender realignment (although it cuts our balls off every bit as decisively as the biological version). I’m all for stamping out sexist terminology in the workplace (I’m not suggesting that Daisy be called “top bird” or “number one bi-atch”). It’s just that it needs to be done by people who understand language a bit better. It’s all very well for soppy, four-eyed old Marys from the Liberal Democrats to call themselves “chair” — it’s the only way they’re going to trick anyone into throwing his leg over them — but not Daisy. So let’s just call her Daisy. No, wait. Daisy is so obviously a lady’s name. That’s sexist, that is. Let’s call her Leslie, because that could be anyone.</p>
        <p>So anyway, Leslie complained of the books she had to read, “There’s not been much wit and not much joy, there’s a lot of grimness . . . There are a lot of books that start with a rape.” And for the past couple of days there have been endless articles about how sad that is, and whatever happened to comic novels and light novels, and all that, and they’ve all been by women. And I’m worried I’m not allowed to join in the debate because the Orange Prize is your ball and you decide who plays with it. (Apologies for that schoolboy metaphor. I’d have thought of a gender non-specific one except, you see, I am a boy, so I can’t: I’m simply trapped in the epic phallogocentrism of the patriarchal canon).</p>
        <p>But I do want to say something. And it is this. Books by men are invariably grim and depressing, too. A couple of years ago I was a judge on the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, which is open to all genders but only if they are under 35 (you always have to have some sort of restriction on eligibility for literary prizes, otherwise Jeremy Clarkson would win them all). And, let me tell you, every single one — or at least it felt like every single one — was about child abuse. Or, at best, bullying. Always some toddler gets mashed up by a teenager who turns out to have been abused by someone else and then gets killed by someone who is even worse.</p>
        <p>At least two thirds, possibly more, of the books I read for the prize, could have been summarised like that. And that includes the winner, which was nonetheless a terrific book.</p>
        <p>Though not ungrim.</p>
        <p>And the reason? I can tell you the reason. Creative writing courses. Pointless, stupid, irrelevant bloody creative writing courses. Of the 80-odd writers under scrutiny in that year’s JLR, three quarters were the product of creative writing courses, and most of those were graduates of UEA. And I’ll wager those stats hold up for the Orange Prize, too. It’s the easiest thing for a publisher to do: call up an old mate who used to write but now just drinks and teaches, hand out £2,000 for each of a dozen rubbish books by his illiterate students, who’ve gone on the course because they want to get a script-editing job on <i>EastEnders,</i> and keep your fingers crossed that one of them flies. Low-cost input, minimal support investment: huge potential return.</p>
        <p>But all creative writing graduates can do is write the same book, over and over again. And it’s an Ian McEwan book. Which is fine if you are Ian McEwan. But not if you’re not.</p>
        <p>McEwan was the first ever graduate of Malcolm Bradbury’s UEA course, and remains by far the most successful. He is the reason these courses blossom and multiply. He is the reason the books get published.</p>
        <p>And think what his books are about: child rape (<i>Atonement</i>); interspecial rape (<i>Black Dogs</i>); sexual torture (<i>The Comfort of Strangers</i>); and then even the relatively unrapey <i>Saturday</i> has some poor girl forced at gunpoint to strip naked and read Matthew Arnold’s <i>Dover Beach.</i> And when there isn’t a rape, like in <i>The Child in Time,</i> you get toddler-abduction.</p>
        <p>And McEwan is our best and gravest and most celebrated writer. Who wouldn’t copy him? The kids on these dumb-arse courses are told to put something dark at the heart of their bourgeois fantasy, because that is what grown-ups do. And so they read a quick McEwan and think: “Ooh, child rape, dog rape, rape in a balloon . . . marvellous!” And off they go.</p>
        <p>Male writers have for years been accused by feminist critics of textual exploitation in the persistent use of violence against women as a plot device — from Defoe, at the dawn of the novel, raping Moll Flanders and Roxana, through Richardson and his Clarissa, through the Gothic novel and into the dross of the 19th century, through almost every episode of <i>Morse</i> to McEwan himself.</p>
        <p>What Leslie is lamenting in the tone of the Orange Prize entries is perhaps nothing more than women taking control of their own rapes at last, and getting a few pages out of them.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://www.designer-notes.com/?p=195" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: “Fear and Loathing in Farmville”">“Fear and Loathing in Farmville”</a></h2>
        <p>March 19th, 2010 Soren Johnson Posted in <a href="http://www.designer-notes.com/?cat=4" title="View all posts in Games" rel="category">Games</a> |   <a href="http://www.designer-notes.com/?p=195#comments" title="Comment on “Fear and Loathing in Farmville”">55 Comments »</a></p>
        
        <p>GDC 2010 is now in the books, and it will be a hard one to forget because the whole conference seemed to be obsessed with one thing, which I summed up in <a href="http://twitter.com/SorenJohnson/status/10379801631">this tweet</a>. Or, as Sirlin puts it <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2010/3/10/gdc-2010-the-day-before-day-1.html">here</a>: “Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, Facebook.” Off the top of my head, here are the highlights and lowlights of this fixation:</p>
        <ul><li>The long-running Casual Games and Virtual Worlds Summits have vanished entirely from the conference, presumably eaten up by the new Social Games Summit.</li>
        <li>Ngmoco’s Neil Young describing the growth of free-to-play online games as “the most significant shift and opportunity for [game developers] since the birth of this business.” This shift fundamentally changes the way game are made because developers can now launch early and adjust based off play patterns and user metrics.</li>
        <li>Zynga’s Mark Skaggs, formerly of EA, praised metrics as the answer to most game design problems. Much has been made about their discovery that pink was the best color for advertising Zynga’s other games, but the telling point was when Skaggs said that “if a player repeats something, it’s fun.”</li>
        <li>My old <em>Spore</em> teammate Chris Hecker railed against external rewards as a true motivator as they can mask an otherwise dull game. Further, focusing primarily on metrics can actually make the game worse because they can overvalue external rewards, which are easier to measure. Chris also leveled this broadside at metrics-focused companies: “If you are intentionally making dull games with variable ratio extrinsic motivators to separate people from their money, you have my pity.”</li>
        <li>Carnegie Mellon’s Jesse Schell walked back from the ledge of his now <a href="http://g4tv.com/videos/44277/dice-2010-design-outside-the-box-presentation/">infamous DICE talk</a> on pervasive rewards systems, saying that doomsday is not inevitable. He went on to explicitly draw the line in a new war between persuaders (developers who want players’ money) and the rest of us (who want to give the players joy). When addressing persuaders, Schell actually used the phrase “you know who you are.”</li>
        <li>Zynga’s Bill Mooney offended the entire independent games community in his acceptance speech for <em>Farmville</em> at the Choice Award by defining the Facebook game as “just as indie” and then trying to recruit everyone in the audience, many of whom have open disregard for Zynga. Josh Sutphin had a message for him: <a href="http://www.third-helix.com/blog/?p=885">“Learn some fucking tact.”</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.third-helix.com/blog/?p=885"></a>Brian Reynolds, who is now Zynga’s Chief Designer, showed up on no less than three panels to point out repeatedly that social games need to be social first and games second. <em>Farmville</em>’s crop-withering mechanic, in particular, was referenced as a not-fun mechanic that compels people to play out of a sense of shame. (What if my real-life friends see how poorly I am maintaining my own farm?)</li>
        <li>Daniel James of Three Rings puzzled over the phrase “social gaming” as he felt that his old games (such as <em>Puzzle Pirates</em>) were far more social than <em>Farmville</em>, which is a primarily single-player game in which players pass around “tokens.” At multiple times during the conference, James expressed his serious ethical qualms over the path social gaming was laying for the industry. So many of the methods for making money are thinly-veiled scams that simply exploit psychological flaws in the human brain.</li>
        <li>At a panel on why “dinosaur” designers are flocking to social games, Reynolds, Slide’s Brenda Brathwaite, Noah Falstein, and Playdom’s Steve Meretzky all praised social gaming as a new frontier where radical and rapid innovation exists, in contrast to the more conservative world of AAA retail games.</li>
        <li>Sid Meier only briefly touched on <em>Civilization Network</em>, his new Facebook project, in his conference keynote, but what else needs to be said? Sid Meier is making a Facebook game! (Quite literally, in fact, as Sid is doing his usual designer/programmer thing.) Further, the three primary designers of  the <em>Civilization</em> franchise (Sid, Brian, and myself) are all now making social/online games.</li>
        </ul><p>What is to be made of all this? Meretzky made a key point in the dinosaur panel that, with free-to-play games, there is no more separation between game design and game business. Every change to a game’s balance might immediately and significantly affect revenue. Will it go down because the virtual items for sale are now less desirable compared to the free ones? Or will it go up because the player is now inconvenienced enough to buy a boost? Or will it go down because the inconvenience has driven away enough of the core fanbase? (I made a similar point in my <a href="http://www.designer-notes.com/?p=115">Nov 2008 column</a> on designing free-to-play games.)</p>
        <p>The question on most developers’ minds is the following: what is the role of the game designer in this new world where business and design mix in such fundamental ways? The answer to this question drives fear in the heart of the boy or girl beating inside most professional game developers. Brian Reynolds himself often pointed out that the role of Zynga’s Chief Designer is not actually as important a position as one might imagine. At the <a href="http://www.livegamer.com/gdc/agenda.html">VCON Summit</a>, Eric Goldberg of Crossover Technologies suggested that companies “use the tactics that make the most money possible… that your staff can live with.” At that summit’s keynote, David Perry talked about the morally dubious “treasure chests” of <a href="http://www.danwei.org/electronic_games/gambling_your_life_away_in_zt.php"><em>ZT Online</em></a>, which provoked a <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2010/3/10/gdc-2010-the-day-before-day-1.html">visceral response</a> from Sirlin:</p>
        <p>This egregious, unethical practice is the kind of thing he should have presented as extremely dangerous. If you are “playing to win” in business, yeah, you’d do that. But doing so is damaging to the lives of our own customers… I mean personally, I’m embarrassed to be part of an industry that so blatantly manipulates people like rats in a skinner box, and isn’t he embarrassed about that too?</p>
        <p>This debate over business-vs-design spawned a <a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showthread.php?t=58231">thread</a> at Quarter to Three in which game developers are expressing their feelings over <em>Farmville</em> and its ilk:</p>
        <p>It’s not social games as a threat to game design, it’s money-driven treadmill games that’s a threat to game design. A coworker identified a similar problem with a money-driven free-to-play social game, in which they specifically destroyed the balance in key ways at times in order to persuade the players to pay money to fix their own game balance. It is a war. It’s suits versus the creative people. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2128739&amp;postcount=4">link</a>)</p>
        <p>I can’t believe one of the most important figures in strategy gaming [Brian Reynolds], the guy who had a major hand in bringing us absolute classics like <em>Civ 2</em>, <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, <em>Rise of Nations</em>, and <em>Rise of Legends</em> is now Chief Designer for those creeps at Zynga. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2129840&amp;postcount=21">link</a>)</p>
        <p>I don’t like that at all. It turns my art into a business intent only on making as much money as possible. And while making money is the goal for the large industry, the fact is that we’re still as much about creating great experiences first and foremost, and the money is a happy second. With <em>Farmville</em> and such, the premise is to make a lot of money, and that is the drive that informs every single decision. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2130413&amp;postcount=48">link</a>)</p>
        <p>Making the game worse can make it generate more revenue. The lesson is to focus on generating fast bucks over improving the artistic quality of your game. Enjoyment isn’t as important as long as they keep paying and playing. The dividing line flaring up is an old one; are games an artistic endeavour furthering culture or are they just slot machines to be designed for revenue maximization? (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2130462&amp;postcount=54">link</a>)</p>
        <p><em>Farmville</em> makes overt use of known psychological techniques to influence and control behaviour and ties that directly into revenue generation. . . . When you have games industry professionals from large companies arguing that we shouldn’t worry about making a game less enjoyable as long as it generates more revenue – to me that is something to be concerned about. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2130514&amp;postcount=58">link</a>)</p>
        <p><em>Farmville</em>’s formula is simple. Make it easy to scream forward to the point where you can’t properly spend your coins anymore without spending real money. . . . Do not misunderstand me, I am saying, without any ambiguity, that doing this is <strong>wrong</strong>. I see very little difference between this and tactics at stores such as raising the price of something, removing functionality, and slapping a “On Sale 40% Off!” sign on it. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2130517&amp;postcount=59">link</a>)</p>
        <p>The question will be, when it comes to tuning Brian Reynold’s Facebook game, will the guiding principle be increasing Zygna’s revenue or making the game more fulfilling? (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2130570&amp;postcount=65">link</a>)</p>
        <p>The Zynga guy said, you need to identify what people are doing most often in a game, because that’ll be the most fun activity. If that were true, the funnest activity in <em>Starcraft</em> is building Zerglings and the funnest in late-game <em>Civ IV</em> is clicking END TURN. (<a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2132986&amp;postcount=95">link</a>)</p>
        <p>Obviously, developers are wary of how Facebook gaming will change the industry in the years ahead. (Compare the importance of business metrics now with 1997’s <em>Ultima Online</em>, which lead designer Raph Koster <a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showpost.php?p=2133398&amp;postcount=129">points out</a> “wasn’t designed around any business model in particular.”) The irony is that Facebook games typically share four characteristics that really do promise great things for both gamers and designers:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>True friends list</strong>:  Gaming can now happen exclusively within the context of one’s actual friends. Multiplayer games no longer suffer from the Catch-22 of requiring friends to be fun while new players always start the game without friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Free-to-play business model</strong>:  New players need not shell out $60 to join the crowd. Consumers don’t like buying multiplayer games unless they know that their friends are all going to buy the game as well. Free-to-play removes that friction.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent, asynchronous play</strong>:  Finding time to play with one’s real friends is difficult, especially for working, adult gamers. Asynchronous mechanics, however, let gamers play at their own pace and with their own friends, not strangers who happen to be online at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics-based iteration</strong>:  Retail games are developed in a vacuum, with designers working by gut instinct. Further, games get only one launch, a single chance to succeed. Most developers would love, instead, to iterate quickly on genuine, live feedback.</li>
        </ul><p>These four pillars are the reason why many game developers are flocking to Facebook. (Of course, many of these characteristics are not exclusive to Facebook, but combining them together with such a large audience makes Facebook the obvious choice right now.) However, Jesse Schell is right; a war is brewing over who will call the shots. However, the question is not simply one of suits-vs-creatives. The question is will designers take the time to learn the business, to learn how to pay the bills while also delivering a fantastic game experience? As BioWare’s Ray Muzyka put it during a panel on connected gaming, ultimately all decisions are made with a goal to make money, but the goal may be short-term revenue (“can we sell more blue hats tomorrow?”) or long-term growth (“does our community believe in what we are doing? are we creating life-long fans?”). The successes will not come from open conflict between design and business but from developers who internalize the tension and attack the problem holistically.</p>
        <p>I have to admit my own reservations about this transformation; game design itself simply might be not as much fun as it used to be. I cannot easily sum up how enjoyable brainstorming a game is during the early, heady days of blue skies and distant deadlines. With a release-early-and-iterate mentality, these days are now over, for good. Games will no longer be a manifestation of an individual’s (or a team’s) pure imagination and, instead, will grow out of the murky grey area between developers and players. The designer-as-auteur ideal is perhaps incompatible with this model, but I believe the best game designers are the ones willing to “get dirty” – to engage fully with a community to discover which ideas actually work and which ones were simply wishful thinking. Loss of control is never fun, but as Sid is fond of saying, the player should be the one having the fun, after all, not the designer.</p>

        <p><a class="tagautolink autolink" title="Click here to read more posts tagged #billcaswell" href="http://jalopnik.com/tag/billcaswell/">Bill Caswell</a>, an unemployed Chicago racing freak, entered the Mexico round of the World Rally Championship in a 1991 BMW 318i that he found on Craigslist. The car cost $500. One year ago, Caswell decided that he wanted to go rallying with <a href="http://www.rally-america.com">Rally America</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jalopnik/4306746318/sizes/l/in/photostream/">Two months later</a>, he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jalopnik/4306006287/sizes/l/">crashed a car</a> and blew up an engine <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jalopnik/4306746378/sizes/l/in/photostream/">five minutes</a> into his <a href="http://www.rallytennessee.com/2009/">first event</a>. Four events later, he found a loophole in the FIA rules that let him enter a twenty-year-old car in the same event as guys like Ken Block and former F1 driver Kimi Raikkonen.</p>
        <p></p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Full disclosure: Caswell is my friend. We have a long history of collaborating on stupid, pointless projects. Most of the time, we hang out in weird bars and at race tracks and talk about the cool things that I want to do but never find time for, the things that Bill actually goes and does. I am admittedly biased.</em></p>
        <p>The story of Caswell's WRC entry is a story of weirdness: He entered the biggest motorsport event of his life with no crew; an untested, week-old E30 M3 engine swap and a junkyard transmission (don't ask); a car that was still covered in dirt from the previous season's rallies ("I'd wash it, but I gotta fix stuff instead"); and a rented panel van. His co-driver, a Rally America <a href="http://www.worldrallysport.com/content/pirating-wrc-corona-rally-mexico-rally-america">genius named Ben Slocum</a>, had not spent more than five minutes in a car with him prior to the event. He did this not out of stupidity, but out of a lack of resources — he wanted to go rallying, and this was the only way he could make it happen.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, they finished third in their class.</p>
        <p></p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p>WRC Mexico took place two weeks ago. I wasn't able to attend, but thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I got a non-stop feed from Cas while he was there. I was originally going to write a story summing it all up, but the emails — Bill's wild-eyed, how-did-I-get-here updates from the road — proved to need no embellishment. Here they are. Enjoy.</p>
        <p><em>(Note: This is a long one. If you do nothing else, watch the videos and read the bold sections. The emphasis/bold is mine, not Bill's.)</em></p>
        
        <p>The story got dumped into my inbox in fits and starts. This is the first thing I got after not hearing from him for a week:</p>
        <blockquote readability="1">
        <p>I think I am in second. But I went off and ripped the drivers rear shock right out of the car. Might be able to weld it but service is like a half hour.  </p>

        <p>Yeah, that's reassuring. Huh?</p>

        <p>It got crazier from there. I had no phone calls, no updates, just random emails. They got longer and more rambling as time went on. The video above — the rally's ceremonial night start, with thousands of people, a car turntable, and some strange live music in the background — was taken with Bill's phone. It showed up in my inbox without warning during the weekend.</p>

        <p>Oh, yeah: The cops shut the highway and city streets down so we could get from city to city fast. Well let me tell you that <strong>hauling ass on rally tires with other rally cars while Mexican cops try to keep up with you is priceless.</strong> Not to mention the streets are just lined with people for over 20 miles.  It was amazing. Got there too late to do reconnaissance and had to mooch stage notes from the Peruvian rally champion. Dude is cool but notes are in Spanish or something. So <em>e's</em> are rights and <em>d's</em> are lefts?</p>
        <p>The FIA put a huge GPS device in the car. <strong>We stop for ten seconds without sending a "We are OK" message and they don't hear anything by the 30-second mark, we get a medivac helicopter on our asses</strong> and the stage is canceled. A radiator tube was leaking during tech inspection, and when I was messing with it, one of the officials noticed. I told him it was overflow and just water?</p>

        <p>I once asked Bill why he insisted on going through every spectator section crossed up and with the engine banging off the limiter. "Dude," he said, "I don't care if it costs me a couple of tenths. It makes the fans go <em>nuts.</em>"</p>

        <p>Fuel pump seized with three stages left. I took it out, banged on it, borrowed a knife from a police officer and cut up some random cockpit harness to reverse the flow and banged on it until it worked again. But we were a few minutes late. We hauled ass and caught up. Was going to make the last two but got lost and was ejected for day. Oh well.</p>

        <p>Have four hours to sleep, most sleep have had in a week. Car is perfect. Fuel pump fixed by the side of the road. Fixed rear sway bar. Changed to fresh tires. Fabricated new hood tie downs with a borrowed welder — had to borrow a larger generator to run it, too — b/c mine cracked off. Trans brace was held on with only one nut left and loose and halfway undone. Got lucky.</p>
        <p>Also, after fixing fuel pump, we show up at the next stage late. The officials are like, "The fans think the stage is over, people are now walking down the stage, there are pickups in the middle of the road, you can't run it." I had to drive 15 mph, while being timed, through a stage we normally would have gone 100 mph through. <strong>If that wasn't enough, [redacted]ing Kimi Raikkonen launched his car off the side of the cliff.</strong> A flatbed wrecker was pulling his car out of a ditch and blocking the road.

        <p>This is the note that made my heart jump into my throat.</p>
        <blockquote readability="13">
        <p>Just rocked the first stage of the day. Thirty kilometers of craziness. I came through this 70-80 mph section with thousands of people lining the roads. We come around a corner and there's a bridge that somehow got missed in the notes. But it's a flat piece of concrete like 15 feet wide and our trajectory is right off the side. <strong>Slocum says into the mic, "We're done," stops reading notes, and braces for impact. The river below has boulders the size of Volkswagens.</strong> Sand and gravel in corner, almost as if spectators filled it. Can't get to apex, four feet off, sliding way wide, exit of corner is entrance to bridge. I pitch the car and floor it. 35-45 mph. Half the car falls off the bridge. We are looking at daylight and I am full throttle hoping the left tire and diff can put the power down. We fell so far over the bridge it collapsed the inner leg of the trailing arm by an inch or two. Almost the entire right side of the car hanging in the air. Now in the queue for Stage Two, six more to go.  </p>
        <p>They just closed the stage! Not sure why but assuming accident. Block, Sordo, and someone else all stuffed hard on the last stage. We got beat by both Evos but only by about 45 secs over 23 min. They have turbos. We're over a mile up in elevation.</p>
        <p>Trailing arm has a one-inch dent in it from where we hit the bridge. That's what saved us — it popped the car back up onto the bridge. The car smacked the bridge two inches from the bolt that attaches the subframe to the body.</p>

        <blockquote readability="7">
        <p>Mooched a welder and welded the shock tower back into the car last night and it held. But on the first stage the shock mount blew through. Then the aux fan fried and kept melting fuses and it was hot. On the third stage we missed a jump call (our notes were in Portuguese or something) and hit it at like 80 mph or so and exploded into the air. The launch <strong>felt like hitting a brick wall and broke a motor mount arm clean in half.</strong></p>
        <p>But the jump was amazing. Later I had a minor off but regained the road. <strong>Some kids threw boulders in the road on a transit and I punctured my gas tank</strong> losing nearly a half tank in 24 km on the next stage. Best part, the officials pointed out our leak and showed a handful of gas to us when we asked how big it was — I knew we were screwed, but they said we could start the stage so we did. I <strong>patched it with just stuff in the trunk — RTV and balls of duct tape</strong> — twenty feet after the stage finish, on the side of the road, with the officials watching. Didn't have time at service to fix it so five stages tomorrow with RTV patch. Barely finished the rest of the day. I have a 10 minute service in the morning when we pull the car from parc ferme but we need to put on fresh tires.</p>
        <p>I ran into the Rally Mexico organizers in the bar. Petter Solberg is in there doing shots. Having entirely too much fun. Only three real stages tomorrow anyway. But apparently the ex-WRC car in my class or the Evo broke on the final stage which means I am back into third place.     </p>

        <p>Oh yeah. Parc ferme — they lock your car up and you can't work on it at night. But you can pull it out for a 45-minute service.  So before the final time control, I climbed under the car and undid the motor mount arm with the awesome little factory tool kit in the trunk. So then I could fab up the new part at my convenience and then pull the car out of parc ferme just to swap arms. It worked great. We now have a steel arm and factory mount. Gas tank still patched with RTV and duct tape. Wasn't time to drain tank and JB Weld it. Hopefully it stays on today.</p>
        <p>By the way. It's awesome to be rocking a BMW down here and smoke the little WRC Peugeot cup cars in a chassis that hasn't been pro rally racing since the Prodrive E30 M3 era. <strong>The party tonight is supposed to majorly epic.

        <p>Slocum and I were estimating. <strong>I signed autographs for three hours straight on Sunday alone</strong>. He thinks it might be close to 1500 or 2000 autographs and maybe 1000-1500 pictures. <strong>A couple hundred people were screaming "Caswell!

        <strong>UPDATE:</strong> There has been some confusion regarding Caswell's finish and the class that he and Slocum competed in. Thanks to <a href="http://jalopnik.com/people/CmndrFish/">Cmndrfish</a> for <a href="http://jalopnik.com/comment/20802120/">most of the following,</a> which should clear things up:</p>
        <p>The class he raced in is called Rally America, but it has no affiliation with the stateside sanctioning body of the same name. You can find the results (in PDF form, by stage) at www.rallymexico.com. Caswell and Slocum achieved a total time of 5:29:38.4 after penalties, enough for a third-place finish in their class and a hypothetical 23rd if the two men had been competing in WRC.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five drivers competed in the WRC class at Rally Mexico. Caswell and Slocum didn't just compete with $400,000 race cars, they beat them.</p>

        <div><h1>Paid to Fail - Project Syndicate</h1><div id="column" dir="ltr" lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" class="text_content" readability="47" xml:lang="ar">
        <!-- for the fb div //-->    <img width="159" height="200" class="newsart" id="newsart" src="/newsart/a/b/9/jk364_thumb3.jpg" /> <p>CAMBRIDGE – In a report just filed with the United States court that is overseeing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, a court-appointed examiner described how Lehman’s executives made deliberate decisions to pursue an aggressive investment strategy, take on greater risks, and substantially increase leverage. Were these decisions the result of hubris and errors in judgment or the product of flawed incentives?
        </p>
        <p>After Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers melted down, ushering in a worldwide crisis, media reports largely assumed that the wealth of these firms’ executives was wiped out, together with that of the firms they navigated into disaster. This “standard narrative” led commentators to downplay the role of flawed compensation arrangements and the importance of reforming the structures of executive pay.
        </p>
        <p>In our study, “The Wages of Failure: Executive Compensation at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers 2000-2008,” we examine this standard narrative and find it to be incorrect. We piece together the cash flows derived by the firms’ top five executives using data from Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We find that, notwithstanding the 2008 collapse of the firms, the bottom lines of those executives for the period 2000-2008 were positive and substantial.
        </p>
        <p>Most importantly, the firms’ top executives regularly unloaded shares and options, and thus were able to cash out a lot of their equity before the stock price of their firm plummeted. Indeed, the top five executives unloaded more shares during the years prior to their firms’ meltdown than they held when disaster came in 2008. Altogether, during 2000-2008, the top executive teams at Bear Stearns and Lehman cashed out about $1.1 billion and $850 million (in 2009 dollars), respectively.
        </p>
        <p>These payoffs to top executives were further increased by large bonus compensation. During 2000-2007, the top executives’ aggregate bonus compensation reached (in 2009 dollars) $300 million at Bear Stearns and $150 million at Lehman. Of course, the earnings that provided the basis for these bonuses evaporated in 2008. But the firms’ pay arrangements did not contain any “claw-back” provisions that would have enabled the firms to recoup the bonuses that had already been paid.
        </p>
        <p>Combining the figures from equity sales and bonuses, we find that, during 2000-2008, the top five executives at Bear Stearns and Lehman pocketed about $1.4 billion and $1 billion, respectively, or roughly $250 million per executive. These cash proceeds are substantially higher than the value of the holdings that the executives held at the beginning of the period. Thus, while the long-term shareholders in their firms were largely decimated, the executives’ performance-based compensation kept them in positive territory.
        </p>
        <p>The divergence between how top executives and their companies’ shareholders fared raises a serious concern that the aggressive risk-taking at Bear Stearns and Lehman – and other financial firms with similar pay arrangements – could have been the product of flawed incentives. The concern is not that the top executives expected their aggressive risk-taking to lead with certainty to their firms’ failure, but that the executives’ pay arrangements – in particular, their ability to claim large amounts of compensation based on short-term results – induced them to accept excessive levels of risk.
        </p>
        <p>It is important for financial firms – and firms in general – to reform compensation structures to ensure tighter alignment between executive payoffs and long-term results. Executives should not be able to pocket and retain large amounts of bonus compensation even when the performance on which the bonuses are based is subsequently sharply reversed. Similarly, equity incentives should be subject to substantial limitations aimed at preventing executives from placing excessive weight on their firm’s short-term stock price.
        </p>
        <p>Had such compensation structures been in place at Bear Stearns and Lehman, their top executives would not have been able to derive such large amounts of performance-based compensation for managing the firms in the years leading up to their collapse. This would have significantly reduced the executives’ incentives to engage in risk-taking.
        </p>
        <p>Indeed, calls for comprehensive and robust reform of pay structures should not be viewed as mere responses to populist anger. Such reform could do a great deal to improve incentives and prevent the type of excessive risk-taking that firms encouraged in the years preceding the financial crisis – thereby enhancing the value of companies and the wealth of shareholders. Reforms that redress these destructive incentives should stand as an important lesson and legacy of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and the crisis they helped to fuel.

        <!-- Generated by XStandard version 2.0.0.0 on 2010-04-28T15:16:08 --><p>New Labour combined two fundamental elements in its energetic break with the lethargy, nostalgia and incompetence of Old Labour: emancipation and centralisation. The long struggle to modernise the left culminated in a coup, staged with exceptional discipline and determination by Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Their authoritarianism was in part a response to the equally bullying sectarianism of the left. At the same time, it drew inspiration from the audacity of the boardroom, the idea of human rights and the world of international wealth and power. New Labour's "market pluralism" offered freedom from the narrow oppressions of both the labour movement and ruling-class elitism. Along with its grasping for power, celebrity and control, there was the liberating potential for democracy and reform. But that promise has now been sacrificed to the claims of an enlightened despotism.</p><p>At the time of the 2005 election, the columnist Polly Toynbee, concerned the Tories might win because of Labour abstentions over the Iraq war, offered anyone who would go to the polls rather than sit on their hands in disgust "a free wooden nose peg with Vote Labour on it". If you wanted a better society, you should hold your nose and vote the party back in, was her influential call - and it succeeded.</p><p>Rightly, Toynbee had a positive assessment of what Labour had initially achieved. And, looking forward, she argued that the main reason for re-electing the party in 2005 was that Blair would be replaced by Brown. Toynbee seemed to believe, as I and many others did, that Brown would reignite the democratic, progressive and egalitarian side of New Labour when finally he had the chance to lead it. He read books. He knew the arguments. He was passionate about helping the poor and was a dedicated constitutional reformer, convinced of the need to engage with the public.Many saw through this, however - Scots especially. When I argued that Brown would be different, the journalist and former <em>New Statesman</em> editor John Lloyd, a Blair supporter, was emphatic that I was projecting my desires on to Brown, who would prove to be no better. Lloyd was right.</p><p>The pity of it was that Brown did launch his premiership with the promise of constitutional renewal, and the initial popularity he gained was more than just relief at Blair going. Voters wanted a new approach. Brown had the capacity and the advisers to understand this. But to summarise what happened between July 2007 and June 2009: he could have chosen democracy; instead he chose Mandelson.</p><p>Last summer he had another chance. The MPs' expenses scandal broke. Among leading British politicians outside the Liberal Democrats, he was perhaps the only one who could claim he had always wanted bold measures to sweep away a broken system with a new settlement. He chose not to. I mention this history to distinguish the situation now from that which obtained in 2005. One has to make a judgement about the direction a party's leaders are taking. The government is firmly in the hands of Brown and Mandelson, who have an unquenched will to power. Any victory will be theirs. We can judge them by their settled support for global capitalism, inequality, authoritarianism and deception.</p><h2>Global capitalism</h2><p>In the 1980s the left lost its sense of the future while capitalism, turbocharged by new technology and world trade, projected itself as a planetary project now known as "globalisation". Brown embraced globalisation as socialism in a new guise: a wealth-creating substitute for internationalism that would provide the levers to transform Britain.</p><p>Though an obvious shift to the right, his move retained a vanity that often blemishes the left - the belief that one's role is to be the vanguard of the inevitable force of history. New Labour had its own version of this peculiar combination of determinism and voluntarism: in its jargon, we had to embrace science-based, market-driven modernity, or else suffer the ignominy of becoming yesterday's story.</p><p>On 19 February this year, speaking at an event for "progressive governance", Brown positioned himself for the coming election with a restatement of this creed:</p><blockquote readability="5"><p>With globalisation we have a unique chance to recognise our global independence as citizens and work towards a truly global society: towards a world free from climate-change catastrophe; and a world free from terrorism, poverty, disease, illiteracy and inequality.<br />Together my proposals are the modern progressive way of achieving our historic goals of economic progress, social justice and environmental care.</p></blockquote><p>To achieve this, he called for nothing less than a "constitution for the global financial system". This was a proposal of Blair-like hubris. But what was the contribution regular folk were expected to make towards achieving Brown's "historic goals"?</p><blockquote readability="1"><p>I believe that as we [develop] the skilled jobs of the future we should see social mobility as the modern route to social justice and devise together the radical measures to massively accelerate the rate of social mobility in our societies.</p></blockquote><p>Apparently we must adopt a planetary form of Tebbitism, where everyone has to get on their bike and pedal all the harder to achieve social justice - mobility without liberty.</p><p>Behind this supposedly inspiring vision, the hard edge of Brown's global economics had been set out by Mandelson in a speech to the Work Foundation early the previous month. This was a well-crafted case announcing some sharp proposals, appointments and intelligent policies to encourage economic development outside the financial sector but:</p><blockquote readability="2"><p>First and foremost we need to foster a new climate for enterprise in Britain. There is no substitute for this - no substitute for the drive and ambition that it brings. It can sometimes be a touch ruthless and raw. But it is the single most important engine of economic progress . . .<br />Enterprise and reward go hand in hand. <br />Much as it shocked many of my friends when I said I was comfortable with people making themselves "filthy rich", in the context I was speaking I was simply stating a simple truth: that enterprise and effort should be rewarded. It sets goals to spur people and brings gains to us all. And it is often forgotten that I added the important rider "as long as people pay their fair share of taxes".</p></blockquote><p>That's people paying taxes, not businesses. There was no recognition in the speech that public spirit and investment can also drive growth and progress. Mandelson restated an approach that led to Private Finance Initiatives, privatising the delivery of the health service, and now the disastrous subordination of scholarship to commerce. At first he was a tart for deregulation. Now a touch of government is needed. But we can rest assured that it is only in order to manage Britain as a free market for the good of global capitalism.</p><h2>Inequality</h2><p>New Labour's embrace of globalisation has turned it into an offshore government, judging domestic policy by its appropriateness for international finance and investment. This has disabled Labour's social democrats (and they do exist, in both government and party) from addressing inequality with the self-belief required to make a lasting difference. There is no point to social democracy if it doesn't make society less unequal. How to do this with respect to education, opportunity and income may be complicated, but an egalitarian state is, in my view, a prerequisite to succeeding. Debate on these matters, however, can't begin unless the fundamental ambition is articulated in the first place and acted upon. New Labour has made Britain a better place to live, but is it attempting to make it more equal? Is it a social-democratic or a right-wing government?</p><p>Equality here is not a matter of assisting the poor, imperative though that is. As Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show in their book The Spirit Level, it involves diminishing the overall levels of difference, holding down the corrupting and degrading effects of widening inequality between top and bottom.</p><p>The answer under Blair was clear; he refused to countenance greater equality. Now, under Brown, with Harriet Harman's Equality Bill and the creation of the Government Equalities Office, a serious effort is being made to measure what is happening. This is one of the tricks of Brown's trade. However superficial his policies may turn out to be, he exercises his hegemony by occupying what can be described as the mental terrain of an issue. Raise the question of a social problem under Labour, and a barrage of reports, initiatives, consultations and other evidence will be produced to show how deeply the party knows and how seriously steps are being planned - as if Labour were in opposition, struggling to make a difference. An example is the outstanding report from the National Equality Panel, An Anatomy of Economic Inequality in the UK, published in January. It shows that Britain would have been even more unequal had the Conservatives won the 1997 election - hardly a cause for self-congratulation - and maps the Himalayan rise of top pay and wealth. They know what they are doing.</p><p>The housing shortage symbolises the nature of Brownian policy towards inequality. He had more than ten years to see it coming. He saw it coming. New Labour permitted housing shortfalls that fed the inflation of property prices and could only exacerbate unfairness. When he became Prime Minister and planned a snap election, he pledged an additional 250,000 homes. As with constitutional renewal, the promise makes the failure all the more despicable. So what was Brown doing? Instead of building homes, he was doing all he could to help the City. After he had been anointed Labour leader, but just before he was to replace Blair, Brown gave his final Mansion House speech as chancellor on 20 June 2007. On his watch, the City had become the world's leading financial centre. No sign of shortages here:</p><blockquote readability="8"><p>I congratulate you, Lord Mayor and the City of London, on these remarkable achievements, an era that history will record as the beginning of a new golden age for the City of London . . . And I believe it will be said of this age, the first decades of the 21st century, that out of the greatest restructuring of the global economy, perhaps even greater than the Industrial Revolution, a new world order was created.</p></blockquote><p>Don't just blame the bankers.</p><blockquote readability="7"><p>So let me say as I begin my new job [as Prime Minister], I want to continue to work with you in helping you do yours, listening to what you say, always recognising your international success is critical to that of Britain's overall, and considering together the things that we must do - and, just as important, things we should not do [my italics] - to maintain our competitiveness . . .</p></blockquote><p>Top of his list of what we should not do was "a British Sarbanes-Oxley", the act passed in the US in 2002 after the collapse of Enron. Thus Brown explicitly opposed the need for regulation that he now maintains is essential to the construction of his new world order. Helping make Britain a more equal society was not openly listed as one of the things "we should not do", but the implication was obvious.</p><p>Given its tremendous differentials of wealth and income, Britain needs a major party whose core mission is greater equality. This ought to be the Labour Party. Its policy advisers are now much better equipped to introduce intelligent and effective ways of achieving this. But if the government remains under the control of Mandelson and Brown, it won't embrace them. Labour has to sort itself out in opposition before it can present the electorate with a credible commitment to a "fairer way forward".</p><h2>Authoritarianism</h2><p>In the mid-1980s, Robin Cook told me a story whose veracity I have not been able to confirm, but which has stayed in my mind. Cook had been at a private gathering in Europe during Jim Callaghan's premiership. Monetarism (what today we would call "neoliberalism") was the subject under discussion. Nigel Lawson told the gathering that Britain did not have the conditions to introduce monetarism. Asked what these were, Margaret Thatcher's future chancellor answered, "Water cannon."</p><p>That was at the dawn of neoliberalism. Thatcher and her cabinet subsequently found the requisite conditions: a successful war, a stupid miners' leader who opened the way to a confrontation that destroyed Labour's praetorian guard, huge cash surpluses generated by North Sea oil, Rupert Murdoch, and a realignment of economic power that brought immense productivity increases in its train.</p><p>The political culture that accompanied this change replaced the stiff upper lip and consensus politics with a boastful, authoritarian spirit. But if intimidation was essential to the implementation of the free market it also helped unstitch a historic nation. Thatcher incarnated the tension, agreeing to an EU single market while trying to say "No" to Brussels. It proved even harder for her successors. Blair tried to become a war leader, too, but, unable re-create her populism, turned to faith. Brown attempted a redefinition of Britishness, to deserved derision.</p><p>But below the radar, and from early in the New Labour years, he and Blair initiated an audacious and sustained "transformation of government". Its ample official documents, never debated by parliament, set out to restructure the relationship between the state, citizens and business. It is a programme for a "database state" in which government departments can transfer information on citizens without them knowing, where surveillance is ubiquitous and government becomes the corporate deliverer of Britain's inhabitants to the marketplace. The "DBS", as it is cheerfully known, presents a novel and formidable challenge. A supporter recently told me that the database state is "inevitable and desirable. What we need are strong rights within it, iron-clad privacy within a context of the DBS."</p><p>But there cannot be "iron-clad privacy" within its context. That is the whole point. And I was struck by the combination of the “inevitable" and the "desirable", of fate and enthusiasm, the coin of New Labour from the start, merging delight in power with historical inevitability.</p><p>We are entering a new kind of constitution, one overseen not by judges, but by the Association of Chief Police Officers, organised as a private company outside the reach of Freedom of Information. The state that results can penetrate our daily lives at will without a warrant, log our movements, demand to know our intentions when we travel and compile, as with the DNA database, police records that imply guilt irrespective of charges, let alone a verdict.</p><p>Central to this redefinition of what it will mean to be British is the National Identity Register, with the ID card as its visible expression. This is not a card that permits us to claim our rights as with a passport, which was meant, as the name itself records, to be a laissez-passer, a right to travel. The UK identity card is closer to the electronic tag worn by criminals allowed out on probation. It belongs to the state and will entail an obligation to keep it informed and updated as the state manages our identity for us. Should it become compulsory, it will mark our subordination to the electronic leviathan.</p><p>Hardly popular, you might say, and opinion polls bear this out, which is why the policy itself is also being managed rather than debated. A marvellous example was provided by Brown himself in his party conference speech at the end of September last year:</p><blockquote readability="3"><p>In the last two years we have looked again at how we can give the best security to our British citizens whilst never undermining their liberties. We will reduce the information British citizens have to give for the new biometric passport to no more than that required for today's passport. And so conference, I can say to you today, in the next parliament there will be no compulsory ID cards for British citizens.</p></blockquote><p>I think it is fair to say that without the Convention on Modern Liberty organised by Henry Porter and myself the previous February, such "looking again" would not have occurred. The announcement of no compulsory ID cards got one of the loudest cheers of Brown's conference speech. But what he was really saying was, "Re-elect me and there will be compulsory ID cards after the next parliament." What appeared to be a welcome retreat was in fact a blatant, yet devious, decision to carry forward the creation of the state management of our identities, while sterilising it as an election issue.</p><p>We don't live in a police state. But the potential for a modern authoritarianism has to be reversed, or else its forms of intimidation, far more sophisticated than hosing protesters into the gutter, may become irreversible. On this issue, above all, Brown is imposing his will, and he will have his way, circumventing open debate, unless he is defeated at the polls.</p><h2>Deception</h2><p>Deception is a New Labour hallmark. Its routines were established early in what we can call "the Campbell Code", in which presentation is substance, projection a form of media war and the appearance of truth its warrior sword. It was on display at the Chilcot inquiry as Blair insisted that the invasion of Iraq was a matter of his "judgement" as prime minister. But when Lawrence Freedman queried Blair's judgement for telling parliament it was "beyond doubt" that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, Freedman was told that this was what the former prime minister "genuinely believed". An effortless transformation of the issue into one of sincerity.</p><p>Blair got away with it. And the bankers got away with it, without even as feeble an inquiry as Chilcot. For the public, the scandal of MPs' expenses was decisive - it was a "Gotcha!" moment. Trust won't be "restored" by somehow instilling financial propriety among MPs, because the crisis involved a ruling culture of deception and entitlement having its cover blown. David Cameron can't oppose it credibly, since he presented himself as the heir to Blair. So, when the government attacked the Conservatives over the influence on them of Michael Ashcroft's money, Cameron's reply was that "people in glasshouses shouldn't throw stones". In parliamentary terms, the riposte worked. But the episode confirms that ordinary voters are right to see both parties as living in the same corrupt conservatory. And the taint of corruption is embedded deep in the system. In 1985, in his Mackintosh Memorial Lecture (which Brown would have read at the time), Neal Ascherson argued:</p><blockquote readability="5"><p>It is not possible to build democratic socialism by using the institutions of the Ancient British State. Under that include the present doctrine of sovereignty, parliament, the electoral system, the civil service - the whole gaudy heritage. It is not possible, in the way that it is not possible to induce a vulture to give milk.</p></blockquote><p>Part of the appeal of New Labour before 1997 was the implicit promise that it would tackle this culture head-on. Instead, its leaders stripped away such decrepit checks as parliamentary procedure and cabinet deliberation, so as to exercise all the more fully what is, in effect, royal power. Power thus exercised is intrinsically corrupt. Personally unimpeachable politicians, such as the Miliband brothers, are just as contaminated by it all as Blair.</p><p>Brown could have stopped the rackets that kept backbenchers quiescent in the Commons. He could have abolished the crony appointment of half of our parliament that besmirches the UK's claim to be a democracy. He could have, but he didn't. Instead, he drank the vulture's milk.<br />Here is a test. Ask a Labour candidate if he or she is politically honest. They will assure you that they are. Ask them if they will accept the will of voters in their constituency on election night if they fail to get the largest number of votes. "Of course," they will reply. Then ask them whether, should they be elected, they intend to accept the will of the voters across Britain? Here, there might be a pause for calculation. Taking advantage of the pause, develop the question. Suppose that the Conservatives were to get 5 per cent more votes than Labour - in other words, a clear majority of the popular vote between the two parties - but Labour were to win as many seats. Wouldn't it be dishonest to support Labour in forming the government? Shouldn't they agree that they will not defy the clear preference of British voters by preventing the Tories from realising a chance to exercise power? It will take no time at all for your honest candidate to dismiss such a suggestion as naive. You will be told that you "do not understand" how things work. In fact, you will have understood it very well. It goes to show that we do not have an honest politics, however honest individual MPs may be.</p><p>Brown and Mandelson love being in power. They will do everything they can to stay there. Maybe they have lost interest in the tiresome country that they also have to "run", preferring to call for global constitutions instead. But they need national office, if only as a base from which to advance their planetary pretensions. They long ago replaced their socialist hearts with a triple-bypass that beats to the pulse of globalisation and international finance. And to secure their base, they have initiated a staggering reconstruction of the British state, using their unchecked executive power to modernise our government and policing, and to pre-empt the democracy of constitutional citizenship with hi-tech subjecthood. Brown, Mandelson and Blair are not the only begetters of the corruption of this country's political system; the responsibility lies with the political class as a whole, something that the public understands pretty well. But they alone inherited the power to reform it and they must take the responsibility for failing to do so.</p><h2>The alternative</h2><p>I watched David Cameron talking recently about Brown's suggestion of a referendum on the voting system. He said that what this country needs is "strong government". An involuntary shudder passed through me. Have they learned nothing? What this country needs is an opposition: an alternative to the two-party bad faith on Afghanistan (pity, but we have to stay), the EU (pity, but we have to stay), the House of Lords (pity, but it will have to stay), strong government (got to keep it in order to ensure the above). When the expenses scandal struck, Cameron declared that it was time to give "power to the powerless", while Brown pleaded that he was a long-time supporter of Charter 88. Who are they kidding? Neither will deliver change.</p><p>As there isn't an opposition, we should start to invent one by opening up the political space from which it can emerge. It would be best to do this with the Liberal Democrats, but if not with them, then without them. The slogan is short enough: "Hang 'em".</p><p>We need to hang parliament and hang the two main parties. We need to vote Brown and Mandelson out, first of all, but not vote Cameron and company in to carry on where Labour has left off. We need a hung parliament so that invention and new voices are registered, so that the public can express how it has lost trust in the political class, and different forces be allowed to reshape the political scene. In my view, one of these should be an English voice, so that the United Kingdom can move, at last, to a grown-up federal model. I note this to signal that I am not afraid of such an outcome. Naturally, other populist sentiments will emerge. But the longer they are bottled up, the more twisted and resentful they will become. If we want a progressive realignment, it has to come from below.</p><p>How should we hang 'em? By voting for the candidate most likely to increase the number of independent and third-party MPs of all kinds. That means Lib Dems in constituencies where the party looks the most promising. And Caroline Lucas in Brighton for the Greens; Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party where they have the best chance; even, despite his loathsome attack on Herman van Rompuy, Nigel Farage of Ukip against the Speaker of the House of Commons (who anyway endorses the need for rough justice). Ideally, the Lib Dems would seek English electoral pacts wherever possible, and likewise in Scotland and Wales. Alex Salmond got it right when he said that the SNP should aim to hold the balance of power. This, surely, is the bold approach Nick Clegg, Vincent Cable and Chris Huhne should take. A single list of independents, nationalists, Greens and Lib Dems should be negotiated, on the basis of who is most likely to open up politics, so that everyone can vote to hang the two main parties. And to hot things up, the list should also include maverick MPs from the Tories and Labour - Frank Field and David Davis come to mind. This would send out a different kind of signal from the one the political class expects: that it pays to rebel.</p><p>It's easy to imagine the headlines - especially from the Sun, which "prayed" for Britain to become great again when it switched allegiance to Cameron. It would lead to confusion, it would make us look weak. We'd lose our credit rating and Argentina would invade the Falklands. But think of the upside. Arguments that attract popular support might have influence - thanks to a public, it should never be forgotten, that was wiser than the political class about Iraq. Real thinking could begin, and, who knows, there may be a role for websites and magazines such as the <em>New Statesman</em> in debating the future of the British system, rather than supporting this or that party, this or that faction.</p><p>Those on the left should help Britain vote out New Labour, but frustrate the Cameroons. Brown, Mandelson and Blair had an unprecedented opportunity to reform the British system with public support. Instead, they chose to intensify the centralisation of power. There were important reforms, yet these have only moderated but not reversed the construction of an authoritarian government, dating back to Thatcher, the function of which is to support a profoundly unequal and exploitative global order. Voters don't want this. As the <em>New Statesman</em>'s Mehdi Hasan argued recently, the public is "to the left not simply of New Labour, but the political and media classes as a whole". If he is right, then, in order to let the people speak, we must break open our political-media class and, above all, the two-party system. The best way to do this is to hang 'em.</p><p><em>Anthony Barnett is the founder of openDemocracy and co-edits its British blog, OurKingdom.

        <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/business/media/04carr.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;adxnnlx=1267733822-vj+Zriew7Pm23t97XEPVmg">Humanism</a> temporarily survived the era of electronic media only through the act of turning on a device. The knob or switch is like the cover of a book: Open it; close it. But when a medium is coincident with life, the last refuge for humanism is gone.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The iPad is the beginning of this end. The thin, single pane of glass that comprises the interface is just a window onto the world, an edgeless frame. Essentially, there is no interface, any more than a person’s fingertips are an interface. The long story of humanism — by which I mean the emergence of individual consciousness as a byproduct of our language and literature — comes to an end when we return, futuristically, to doing everything by hand.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>We no longer hear the voices of the past, because we have our fingers in our ears.</p>&#13;

        &#13;
        <p class="blockP">&#13;
        So once again we’ve changed the world with a mind-blowing, revolutionary product that does things that everybody considered impossible. An ebook reader that also plays movies and music? And browses the Web? No way. Can’t be done. Well, we did it. And you can fly three times around the globe and watch movies the whole time on a single battery charge. It’s amazing. Phenomenal. Exciting. Magical. Amazing. Beautiful. Stunning. Gorgeous. And yet for some people in the media, this is not enough. These people are disappointed because they expected the iPad to also save newspapers from a certain death.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Yes, David Carr of <cite>The New York Times</cite>, I’m talking to you, you pie-eyed crackhead. All I can say is, bitch, please! I’m a genius, but I’m not a miracle worker. Nor am I Mother Teresa. I wasn’t put on earth to save <cite>The New York Times</cite>. I was put on earth to restore a sense of childlike wonder to people’s empty, pathetic lives, and I must say that so far I’m doing a pretty outstanding job.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Anyway, do you really think saving newspapers is just a matter of putting your old crap on a new device? Because from what I can see, <cite>The New York Times</cite> sucks just as bad on a Kindle as it does on paper. That, in fact, is the real problem with <cite>The New York Times</cite>: It sucks, and everyone knows it, except, apparently, the dumb fucks who write for <cite>The New York Times</cite>, which is, oddly enough, the heart of the problem. <em>Quod erat demonstrandum</em>, as Socrates once said.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The iPad isn’t about saving newspapers. It’s about inventing new ways of telling stories, using a whole new language — one that we can’t even imagine right now.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Like I said when I met the publisher of <cite>The New York Times</cite> when he begged me to let his new media guy get onstage at our iPad event: Sully, I like you guys, but the truth is you guys really need to die so that we can clear the way for the new guys — although at the same time I do want to commend you for the great job you did when you landed that plane on the Hudson. He’s like, What? And I’m like, Wasn’t that you? And he’s like, No, that’s a guy named <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/nyregion/02sully.html?_r=1&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=sullenberger&amp;st=cse">Sullenberger</a>, and I’m like, Well, what’s your name? and he says, Sulzberger, and I’m like, OK, whatever, but you’re still screwed.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Hacks, I’m sorry, but I’m not going to save you. Frankly, I don’t read magazines or newspapers, and if every last one of you were all erased from the planet tomorrow I would not notice and I would not care. Having said that, I wish you all the best in whatever future careers you choose. Gardening, I’ve heard, is very peaceful and involves slinging manure, so you should be good at it. Namaste. Much love. Peace.</p>&#13;

        <h2><strong class="blockTitle">Ditch Your Laptop</strong></h2>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p class="blockP">&#13;
        Tablets are the future of media — if they become ubiquitous. And that will happen only if they replace laptops. I think most of us are willing to carry two devices (one is a phone) but not three. So why would they dump a keyboard for a touchscreen? Look to three data points for the answer: the iPhone, the Kindle, and the cloud.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The iPhone shows that loads of people want rich-media networked devices with them everywhere. Like a tablet, the iPhone is a one-app-at-a-time full-screen experience, where the interface is determined as much by the apps and the device itself as it is by the OS. By dint of its bigger screen, a tablet is immersive enough to spend hours with — and yet it’s still intimate. A laptop is a work device, an arm’s-length, lean-forward experience. A tablet, in contrast, is a personal device, something you cradle and lean back with.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The Kindle shows that people are willing to pay for specialized devices if they can give them the flexibility to have the content they want when they want it. For magazines, with their long-form text and engaging, visually rich design, a tablet could be perfect. Of course, it will still have a Web browser, but it’ll also have a critical mass of content — games, books, magazines, and video — that isn’t Web-based. All the impact (and more) of print, with the convenience of digital delivery. If it worked for the single-purpose Kindle, it will work even better for the multipurpose tablet. Imagine highly produced, curated content that arrives as an event to look forward to, like a film opening or a book launch. This is where the new business models kick in: Tablets can show media in a context worth paying for. The first issue of a magazine might even be free, like the first few levels of a game are, but that’s just a sampler. Rather than tell people about great content, that tablet lets them experience it — and easily upgrade to get more.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Finally, the cloud shows that as more and more of our data and software lives in servers somewhere, the computers we carry with us can be less and less powerful — thinner, lighter, longer battery life. Let Google buy the big iron; you can buy sexy aluminum and glass that’s a delight to hold. Sure, rich-media apps like games and magazine readers will run locally, but they’ll be no resource-hogging Photoshop. Modern smartphones have shown us what efficient mobile operating systems and specialized apps can do with hardware that wouldn’t fill a single drive bay on a desktop PC.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Think of all the trips where you’ve asked yourself, “Is this when I leave the laptop behind and just use my phone?” The tablet answers that question. Bigger than a phone, funner than a laptop, more cuddly than a Kindle. I think they’re going to sell like hotcakes.</p><p><strong>Pages:</strong> <a class="contentjumplink" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays/3/"> Previous </a> <a class="contentjumpnumber" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays/">1</a> <a class="contentjumpnumber" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays/2/">2</a> <a class="contentjumpnumber" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays/3/">3</a> <span class="contentjumpnumber">4</span><a class="contentjumpall" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/03/ff_tablet_essays/all/1">  | <img src="/magazine/wp-content/images/assets/icon_page.gif" /> Full Page | </a><span class="contentjumplink"> Next </span></p>							</div></div>

        			<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rgphp" title="BBC: Women">BBC Four's recent three-part documentary Women</a> was enough to make any seasoned feminist weep with despair. After sitting through the obligatory first instalment on celebrity second-wavers, and cringing through the second week on post-feminist consumerist mothers, I looked forward to the finale. "Activists" promised to celebrate the resurgence of feminist activism in the contemporary UK. How disappointing, then, that this new feminism turned out to be nothing more than a small group of London-based women who have attracted media attention over the past couple of years with their single-issue campaigns on violence against women.</p><p>There is not a feminist on the planet who isn't outraged at sexual and domestic violence, as well as the overwhelming evidence of the complicity of governments, police forces and justice systems in perpetuating this violence and protecting its perpetrators. Violence against women is rightly a major focus of any feminist movement. But this serious problem cannot be understood, or challenged, in isolation from other forms of violence and oppression, such as racism, restrictive labour and migration laws, and poverty. Yet the groups featured in "Activists" – <a href="http://www.object.org.uk/" title="Object website">Object</a> and the <a href="http://www.ldnfeministnetwork.ik.com/home.ikml" title="London Feminist Network website">London Feminist Network</a> – treat violence against women largely in isolation. They have lots to say about the media objectification of women but, bizarrely, little to say about consumerism or capitalism.</p><p>The favourite topics of these organisations seem to be lap-dance clubs, pornography, lads' magazines and the sex industry in general. This is part of a growing trend in middle-class feminism. <a href="http://www.katbanyard.org/the-equality-illusion.php" title="Kat Banyard: The Equality Illusion">Feminist writers</a> and bloggers <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2009/01/violence_agains_3" title="The F Word: Violence against sex workers: will Smiths plans really make a difference? ">can't seem to get enough</a> of prostitution and pornography these days. But these are not the most important issues for the majority of women. Why should a sex worker be a symbol of sexism any more than a competent professional woman denied promotion in favour of a younger male colleague? Or a teenage girl who doesn't get the education she deserves because her family are too poor to play the postcode lottery or pay tuition fees? Or a migrant woman whose children are locked in a detention centre?</p><p>The serious issues of violence against women, and sexist oppression generally, are grossly simplified when they are constantly associated with the sex industry. Feminist campaigns to eliminate sex work by claiming that it is the same as violence against women are not only bad for the sex workers they aim to protect. They're also bad for feminism.</p><p>The contemporary feminist focus on male violence against women is bad for feminism because it positions women primarily as victims, while giving power to male police and politicians to "protect" us from "bad men". It returns us to the tired old model of two opposing genders: man=masculine=aggressive v woman=feminine=passive. It offers no analysis of, and therefore no effective political opposition to, the ways violence against women relates to other forms of violence that women (and men) experience. But most of all, it's bad for feminism because it defines women's experiences of sex and sexuality exclusively in terms of fear and danger, and reserves for men the privileged terrains of desire and pleasure.</p><p>Anyone who's been around for the past 25 years will hear echoes in these debates of the feminist "sex wars" of the 1980s. What's most depressing about this sense of history repeating itself is that groups such as Object and LFN ignore the wealth of feminist theory on representation, desire and sexuality, as well as the scholarship on the intersections between sexism, racism and class produced over the past few decades. But the blame for this lack of theoretical reflection cannot be placed on activists alone. It must be shared by feminist academics, many of who have abandoned the wider public sphere of political debate and activism in recent years. That too is bad for feminism.</p><p>A return to feminist academic dialogue with activism might help us to understand why so many young women today are attracted to forms of feminism that emphasise male violence against women above other forms of sexism. Other people have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/23/feminism-debate-infighting-gender" title="Cif: Time for a good scrap about what our feminism really is">noted</a> that young feminist groups in the UK today are "predominantly white, middle-class and university-educated". Why are these privileged women so drawn to a movement that positions them first and foremost as victims of patriarchy?</p><p>Luckily there are lots of other feminists out there, from different generations and backgrounds, making links between violence against women and other oppressions. One group recently posted a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/08/international-womens-day-manifesto" title="Cif:  Recommit to women's liberation">Manifesto for 21st-Century Feminism</a> that emphasises women's exploitation in all areas of the labour market, not just the sex industry, and recognises the sexualisation of society as part of contemporary consumer capitalism. That's the kind of feminist resurgence we need.</p>&#13;

        <div><h1>Don’t Say “Don’t” « Dachis Group Collaboratory</h1><div class="dachisgroup" readability="33"><p>So, your business wants to be more “socially calibrated.” You bought the tools, but no one is using them. You have a Twitter account, but no one is responding to tweets. You are confused because when you said, “Let’s do social,” everyone said “YES!” So, what now? You must address corporate culture, which means you need to examine internal behaviors.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Kate Niederhoffer spoke on the “Social Psychological Principles of Change” at our <a href="http://www.socialbusinesssummit.com">Social Business Summit</a> here in Austin. Mainly, bringing about change by promoting positive behaviors, rather than punishing negative ones.</p>
        <p>In her presentation, Kate said to start focusing on changing behaviors rather than changing attitudes. As humans, we have an inherent need to belong. We want to be in agreement with the people around us so that they’ll like us and we’ll fit in. As a result, we will agree to ideas that we don’t fully accept. More and more, social psychologists find that people will generally say they support the stated goal in a group setting, i.e., “Let’s do social!” but then actually behave in the opposite way when no one is looking. So, their attitudes end up saying, “YES!” while their behaviors say “no.”</p>
        <p>How can you change individual behaviors and, in turn, company culture? Realize that it’s easy to “talk the talk,” but you have to get people to “walk the walk” too.</p>
        <ol><li>Start by exposing people to their anti-social behaviors and show them how to develop new behaviors, possibly through a pilot program.</li>
        <li>Don’t make a list of “no no’s.” I have personally seen companies make this mistake often, most obviously in their social media policies. A list of what not to do exacerbates anxiety and seems to more firmly root people in their old behaviors. If you want engagement, you can begin to encourage interaction by telling people what they can do, rather than what they can’t.</li>
        <li>Introduce a new behavior set, not just new tools. Pair newbies up with those who have been playing in social spaces for a while. I think training is key to success. Once people know what they can do, help them understand how to do it. Fear of the unknown can be a major roadblock.</li>
        </ol><p>In reality, this concept is one we’ve been exposed to all our lives. Your mom tells you not to touch the hot stove, and all you can think about is touching the hot stove. Now, as an adult, you tell your employees not to email and all they can think about is emailing. It’s difficult to stop old behaviors and develop new ones, but your business can never be truly social without first addressing culture change.</p>
        <p>What are you doing today to facilitate the culture change that a social business demands? If you’ve got the buy-in for “social,” attitudes are already in line. Now it’s time to start addressing the behaviors that feed your corporate culture. Don’t let your social strategy stall because you fail to encourage the right behaviors.</p>

(The source appears to be the online writing collective <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2312266656&amp;ref=nf">Ink Canada</a>.)

                            <p>Besides the fact that it’s written in all-caps, there’s nothing particularly ranty, pejorative or potty-mouthed about it. Rather, Mamet lays down an extremely sensible case for what makes good television, imploring them to avoid expository writing for what he characterizes as authentic “drama.” Along the way, he refers repeatedly to the “blue-suited penguins” (probably the copious-note-givers at the network), while passing along some very useful advice (“any time two characters are talking about a third, the scene is a crock of shit”) and helpful writing exercises (“pretend the characters can’t speak and write a silent movie”). Screenwriters, take note: You may think you knew this already, but there’s nothing like Mamet for a good kick-in-the-ass reminder.</p>

        									<h3><a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/post/374473607/adaptation">Adaptation</a></h3>&#13;
        									<p>A day after iPad launch, I climbed on my self-publishing platform and declared that those of us excited about the New Thing were correct and exalted in being so, and that those who weren’t were wrong and big meanies. A friend, <a href="http://toomuchnick.com/post/360127595/dont-be-dumb">Nick Douglas got on his self-publishing platform</a>, declared he disagreed and wanted to know why I was so sure that I was right. It’s taken me some time to collect my thoughts, but especially because Nick is a smart and thoughtful guy and his thoughts represent a good cross-section of the public objections, it’s important to me to respond. So I’ll do that here in the style of civil conversation between friends at salon over a tray of hot wings. I’ll preface by saying that <em>this is the stuff</em>; this debate and discussion and handwringing is why any of us who work in or with technology have ever woken up in the middle of the night, excited to keep doing what we do.</p>
        <blockquote>Nick: <em>While some critics are kneejerking, my (and many people’s) motivations for doubt are as valid as yours for hope! I think comparing them to objections to the iPod and iPhone is cheating. I think different people are objecting to the iPad: people who really like Apple’s other products.</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then you remember differently than I do. The only difference between the iPad skeptics of today and the iPhone skeptics of yesterday is that there are now millions of people with iPhones, and a few hundred with iPads. This, of course, will change soon. But in the first six months of 2007, when we were all just a bunch of Mac users with iPods with a wheel you had to spin like a baby’s toy, there were those of us who watched the keynote and the demo videos through misty eyes, fashioned fake iPhones from printed-out .pdfs (yeah I did) and dreamed, literally dreamed of the possibilites of interacting with that tiny computer screen using only our fingers. And there were those (many of my Mac-using friends among them) who thought the idea of touch-typing on a keyboard that small was just dumb and prematurely decided to wait for the model with the hardware keyboard to come out. It may be tough to look back at that period and remember, but the evidence is there.</p>
        <blockquote>Nick: <em>Basically, we wanted a touchscreen MacBook, not a big iPhone. And the iPad is, for now, quite literally a big iPhone without a camera or phone. Its only distinctive feature is its size and an add-on keyboard.</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I’m not so sure that a touchscreen MacBook is really what you want. It may be what you <em>think</em> you want. But now’s the time in this piece where I dig out the <a href="http://www.quotiki.com/quotes/6083">ol’ Henry Ford quote</a> about what people think they want. “If I’d asked my customers what they wanted, they’d have said a faster horse.” To your first assertion, what you <em>want</em> is to interact with your data without the abstraction of a mouse and keyboard. Have you considered the difficulty in that proposition? If you’re curious, take a second and touch the screen of your laptop like you’re doing some work with it. Open and close some windows, move them around, open some applications, tweak some preferences, pay some bills. I think you’re going to find that the interaction model of the Mac OS exists specifically because you have a keyboard and a trackpad below your screen, and those two instruments allow for refined movements within a dense display of information. What the iPhone OS has done is to allow for the removal of that layer of abstraction, and let us touch our information with our actual fingers. And though our fingers are massive and clumsy, every removal of a layer of abstraction between us and our information represents an epochal shift in technology. Like every such shift, sacrifices must be made, and remedial solutions proposed.</p>
        <p>Here is where I make a Big Point. What we <em>want</em> from our technology, in its most elemental form, is to make our thoughts happen. Sure, it’s still very much sci-fi in 2010, but what every calculating machine and telephone and computer and phonograph and light bulb and hammer and every tool ever invented is about at its core is our desire, our evolutionary imperative to control our environment at our will. And we’re getting closer and closer to that happening. But there are still many layers between our intentions and our environment. As time progresses, we will strip away those layers one by one. And it’s <em>always</em> disruptive to do so. The reason that any manufacturer of technology exists is to ease each step of the process of tearing away the layers of abstraction between our thoughts and our realities. The manufacturer with the greatest ability to ease the process is the winner. Thus far, Apple has been the winner. That could change, but the rest of the industry is pretty far behind.</p>
        <p>To your second point, that the iPad is a big iPhone stripped of its camera and phone, I will respond the way many others have already: when you resist the chronology and allow the story to be told nonlinearly, the iPhone is a small iPad with the already familiar form factor of a mobile phone. As a society, it’s crucial that we must be prepared at every step of the way for the introduction of the New Thing by all the New Things of the past. It’s obvious to state that television could not have happened without radio, but it’s always the perfect model for our capacity for adapting to technological change. The iPad could not have existed without the iPhone having been in our hands for three years. Packaging and delivering a computer in the form of a mobile phone was the perfect method for introducing a new model for interaction, represented by the iPhone OS, just as packaging and delivering a computer in the form of a typewriter with a screen was the perfect method for introducing a new model for interaction represented by the original Mac OS and its contemporaries. There was a time when the mouse was considered newfangled. There was a time when people assumed they’d never need a laptop when a big box sat at their desk. And there are reasons that the iPod existed for six years before the iPhone. They mostly have to do with introducing us to the concept of control over massive amounts of data in our pocket, with limited friction. Whether all these evolutionary steps are intentional at any point is anybody’s guess. Steve Jobs said at the <a href="http://d5.allthingsd.com/20070530/d5-gates-jobs-interview/">D5 conference in 2007</a> that Apple has 20 years mapped out ahead. But it’s almost inconsequential, like asking whether biological evolution is intentional. It happens whether we want it to or not.</p>
        <p>And here is where I make another Big Point. People adapt slowly to change. Society is made of a whole bunch of people. Society must adapt slowly to change.</p>
        <p>Back to iPad launch day. With the introduction of the product’s name, I resisted and I resisted hard. I climbed on my self-publishing platform and <a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/post/357608439/say-ipad">I railed against the name</a>. “Apple, you fucked up,” I declared, brandishing a little bullshit linguistics. And it’s not til now, 10 days later, that I realize that I’d readily fallen into the trap I’m usually conscientious in avoiding. In hindsight, my response was reactionary and mean-spirited. Now, 10 days out, when I see or hear or think the word “iPad”, I see the Apple tablet computer, and not a notepad or any other dirty, infantile thing the name might have fleetingly suggested. The “iPad” is now it’s own object, but it couldn’t have existed as such without a little time for me to adapt.</p>
        <p>We all have a different threshold for shock, and we all react differently to change. There is just as much concern in adapting too quickly as in adapting too slowly. We all must adapt at our own pace, preferably without fear and without anger.</p>
        <blockquote>Nick: <em>So yes, the iPad could evolve. But it should have done more of that evolution before it was released in the first place. That’s a valid point to make, and it’s one born out of trust in Apple’s innovative abilities, not out of cynicism.</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Not to belabor the point, but this fits in with the “adapting slowly” tenet. When the first iPhone was released, it wasn’t nearly as fast or as slick as the iPhone 3GS of today. When I first used my iPhone 3GS, my very first thought was “this is finally the iPhone as the iPhone was intended to be”. On iPhone v1, I couldn’t copy and paste, I couldn’t shoot video of my dog, I couldn’t play cool games or know what song was playing in a store. I couldn’t ask it where I was on a map. But that did <em>not</em> detract from its magic. From v1, I could have an email come in with a phone number in its body, I could tap that number and add it to a contact and that number would be in my computer after my next sync. I had never had a phone that could just simply <em>do that</em> before. The point being that yes, hardware will always improve. You will <em>always</em> be tempted to wait for the next iteration of hardware. If you’d rather wait until further iterations to experience the bulk of the magic that already exists in the current one, it’s your choice. It’s a lot of money to be putting down for something you’ll resent for its eventual obsolescence. But if Apple were to develop a product “to completion” before releasing it, holding off until it had all of the features that it thought that people wanted rather than just the ones that make it amazing, Apple would not be Apple, or Apple would never release products. That’s the point of evolution. It doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it necessitates, by design, deliberate response to the demands of the environment.</p>
        <p>The other point being that <em>software</em> will always improve. And software can often be acquired without new hardware. If you still use a first-gen iPhone, you can copy and paste on it, and that’s pretty damn exciting.</p>
        <p>And here’s the next Big Point. To a certain extent, the promise of the iPad is the precedence of software over hardware. By all accounts, the iPad’s hardware has already reached that transcendent level of speed, the one I mentioned having experienced in the iPhone’s 3rd generation. According to my two favorite Apple writers who’ve spent time with the thing (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/ipad_big_picture">Gruber</a> and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2017907,ihnatko-ipad-hands-on-012810.article">Andy Ihnatko</a>), touching and manipulating the UI feels like touching and manipulating objects in real time. This level of maturity of the hardware allows for unfathomable freedom in software. And from a development standpoint, consider that in contrast to the iPhone, developers already have access to the tools to extend the device in software, right from the beginning. No full year of using only Apple-made apps, the developers are already poised to take the iPad further than Apple, exerting <em>way</em> more influence over the transition from this iteration to the next.</p>
        <p>And think of the device itself. It’s a piece of glass. The software is the thing. Yes, it’s in a pretty case. Like all Apple products, the case is the Trojan horse. I’m pretty sure that even with modest enthusiasm for the device, you can reasonably expect giant leaps in what’s possible from the UI, right from the first generation. Of course, I don’t know that and you can’t know that until we pick it up and play with it, but consider this: What if the iPad is a big iPhone? If you’re not still impressed every single time you take your iPhone from your pocket, by what the iPhone is able to achieve, then maybe you’ve just adapted too quickly.</p>&#13;

        During Trevor McDonald Meets ... David Cameron on ITV last Sunday, the Tory 
        party leader was caught wrestling a chocolate bar out of a vending machine 
        at Birmingham Snow Hill railway station. “Are you going to claim it on 
        expenses?” shouted a quick-witted bystander. Cameron had the grace to laugh. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The voters, however, really think the majority of MPs are on the take and 
        their expectations of their leaders have hit rock bottom, too. In the run-up 
        to the general election, the parties have worked hard to remind us of what 
        we disliked about them in the first place. 
        </p>
        <p>
        With the Tories it has been the politics of money, exemplified by the rumpus 
        over Lord Ashcroft’s tax-exempt fortune and the pledges he made to get his 
        peerage. Conservative high command tried to ignore the story, hoping it 
        would go away. It hasn’t. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Now it is the turn of Labour to suffer from ancestral curses. The party’s 
        paymasters, the trade unions, are back to fomenting strikes as if this were 
        the Britain of 40 years ago. Their intransigence is beginning to hurt the 
        government’s standing, as the YouGov/Sunday Times poll shows today. Our 
        splash story also reveals former ministers indulging in one last furious 
        round of lobbying. Influence peddling tarnished new Labour from its very

        As with Ashcroft and the Tories, so with the unions and Labour — the links 
        should have been cut long ago. When Gordon Brown replaced Tony Blair he had 
        the opportunity to clean up party funding, but made it clear in all-party 
        negotiations that he would not cut the party’s financial ties to organised 
        labour. He has had his reward: Unite, a monster union with 2m members, has 
        partly grounded British Airways with a damaging strike that will bring 
        misery to thousands of holidaymakers and business people. 
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no running away from the fact that Unite also happens to be Labour’s 
        biggest donor — it sponsors more than 160 MPs and even pays the salary of a 
        No 10 aide. In return the government slips millions in backhanders to Unite 
        and other unions through “training” schemes such as the Union Modernisation 
        Fund and the Union Learning Fund. Ironically, Brown’s unions friends may 
        help usher Cameron into Downing Street. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As if the prime minister’s cup of woe were not already full — he was forced to 
        admit last week that he had misled the Chilcot inquiry over defence spending 
        — who should pop up in the midst of this ugly dispute but his old hatchet 
        man, Charlie Whelan. Sacked long ago for his lurid role in Chancellor 
        Brown’s war on the Blairites, Charlie has surfaced as political director of 
        Unite. He represents everything the voters mistrust about the governing 
        style: factionalism, spin and skulduggery. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As union fixer, Whelan has been imposing Unite-backed left-wing candidates on 
        Labour constituencies. Meanwhile, Tom Watson, another Brown fixer, has been 
        using his position on Labour’s national executive to purge Blairites from 
        shortlists. In any future leadership election it is reckoned the Unite 
        intake will vote for Ed Balls, the schools secretary and Brown’s anointed 
        heir. This has already led to a public row with James Purnell, the Blairite 
        former cabinet minister. He demanded that Labour’s shortlist for his 
        soon-to-bevacated Stalybridge and Hyde seat should include a candidate who 
        had been excluded in order to give Unite a clear run. Lord Mandelson, who 
        was once driven out of office after Whelan fed stories to the press about 
        the dodgy loan on his house, jumped into the fray. It is all too horribly 
        familiar. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Brown can’t pretend Whelan is just some relic from the past. His crony has 
        been attending meetings in Downing Street and still relishes trashing the 
        boss’s cabinet colleagues. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, has famously 
        alluded to “the forces of hell” unleashed on him by Brown and Balls last 
        summer after he dared give an honest reply to a question about the severity 
        and duration of the recession. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The Conservatives have been swift to exploit Brown’s friendship with 
        sulphurous Charlie. Getting the campaign back on track, George Osborne’s 
        team issued a well researched dossier of Unite’s links with Labour. Michael 
        Gove, the education spokesman, followed up with a fiery speech about 
        Labour’s “new militant tendency”. Peter Watt, a former Labour party general 
        secretary, had already given a helping hand by describing Labour as “the 
        political wing of Unite”. 
        </p>
        <p>
        “I’m not going to hide away or skulk because the Tories want to turn me into 
        some kind of bogey figure,” Whelan riposted. Cameron will be praying he 
        sticks to his word. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Without Brown’s help, the Tories couldn’t have got so far. The prime minister 
        has known since Christmas that a BA strike posed a personal threat. What has 
        he done to stop it? Under normal circumstances he would be well advised to 
        keep clear. But so close to polling day and with bankruptcy in prospect for 
        a national company, his conduct looks like dithering indecision. The PM has 
        condemned the strike as “deplorable”, but rather gave the game away when he 
        told Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour it was not “the right time” for a strike. When 
        is the right time, do you suppose? When the election is safely over.

        	Hierarchy of Parts

        	Parts can be composed with others to make up larger

        	A hierarchy of parts is not a formal part of a pattern language,
        	but constructing such a hierarchy is a good way to begin defining
        	a pattern language, as suggested by Alexander and others in
        	some early treatises on the Pattern Language. 
        	Many parts are given, especially those of nature, and cannot be 
        	changed by design.
        	But the existence of some other parts in a design are themselves
        	patterns, because they help to resolve problematic forces at the
        	interface of other parts, or they respond to a basic human need.

        <div><h1>Game Design Advance » The Truth in Game Design</h1><div class="post-content" readability="49"><p><img class="alignnone" title="Truth in Game Design" src="http://gamedesignadvance.com/wp-content/images/diceHeader.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="100" /></p>
        <p>Jonathan Blow gave a talk recently at Champlain College. The subject of the talk was a game design philosophy in which you ask questions of the universe and then are open and attentive to the answers. In Jon’s view, game systems are like scientific instruments that can reveal complex and fascinating truths about the world. It’s a terrific talk, and you can <a href="http://braid-game.com/news/?p=666">download the whole thing here</a>.</p>
        <p>Jon’s talk made me think of what a couple of brilliant game designers said at GDC.</p>
        <p>In two separate talks Sid Meier and Rob Pardo talked about how players consistently misunderstood, and were frustrated by, randomness. For example players, like most people, tend to subscribe to the “gambler’s fallacy”, the mistaken intuition that random events are spread evenly over time instead of clumping, well, randomly as they actually do. This is the fallacy that leads people to expect a flipped coin to be less likely to land heads after a run of heads.</p>
        <p>Pardo and Meier both described the same solution to this problem, which was to alter the behavior of the game to correspond more closely to the player’s intuition about how randomness <em>should </em> behave. For example, if you have an event that is 50% likely to occur, and it doesn’t occur, then you make it 60% likely on the next attempt, 70% likely after that, and so on until it is certain. Voilà! A coin that is less likely to come up heads twice in a row, and never has a run of more than 6 heads.</p>
        <p>Now, Rob Pardo and Sid Meier are amazing game designers and it’s a privilege to hear them speak. Both talks were full of invaluable insights from practitioners at the top of their profession. But this particular detail really stuck in my head, and rolled around there with Margaret Robertson’s microtalk about behavioral economics and Chris Hecker’s talk about external reward systems, and the numerous discussions of Zynga’s quantitative, behaviorist, social-game design methodology that loomed over the whole conference like Chernabog glaring down from Bald Mountain.</p>
        <p><span id="more-2084"></span></p>
        <p>Eventually this tiny detail, this thoughtful little adjustment of the pillow beneath the player’s head, became emblematic of something big and important at the heart of game design:</p>
        <p>Shouldn’t games be an opportunity for players to wrap their heads around counter-intuitive truths? Shouldn’t games make us smarter about how randomness works instead of reinforcing our fallacious beliefs? Shouldn’t games increase our literacy about interactive systems and non-linear possibility spaces? Isn’t contemplating the <em>elusive truth</em> about these things one of the most powerful cognitive benefits of a life spent gaming? And isn’t it therefore our job and our responsibility to guide players along that rocky path, no matter how uncomfortable it might seem, and at least give them a <em>chance</em> to glimpse the truth and begin to approach it and acquire something far more valuable than comfort, rather than making them a bed on the near side of that stony ground?</p>
        <p>Ok, so maybe not all games have to confront players with difficult universal truths, some games should indulge our superstitions and muffle us in comfort. But we’re talking about <strong>SID MEIER</strong> and <strong>ROB PARDO</strong> here! We’re talking about Civilization and Starcraft! We’re talking pinnacle of computer games, games whose legacies will reverberate for generations. And if we have used computers to build intentional flaws into the numerical heart of our deepest and most cerebral games instead of using them to elevate our understanding of the computational heart of the universe, then we’re doing something wrong.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest gaming experiences of my life was the way that Poker forced me to re-program my own kludgy understanding of probability. It took me a few years of dedicated play and study, years that included as much suffering as they did joy, and moreover in which the joys were somehow uniquely bound up <em>in</em> the suffering. But eventually I got to a place where sometimes I get a little glimpse of the world-as-probability, of the Bayseian logic that boils beneath the solid cause-and-effect surfaces of my everyday, results-oriented consciousness.</p>
        <p>And let’s not forget that Poker, which refuses to bend to our cognitive biases, which takes our naive misconceptions about the world and beats us mercilessly with them and mocks our numerical ignorance and offers only the most dedicated, hardworking players an opportunity to slowly and painfully approach the truth, also happens to be <em>more popular than Farmville</em>.</p>

        						<p>I want to share with you something I’ve learned. I’ll draw it on the blackboard behind me so you can follow more easily [<em>draws a vertical line on the blackboard</em>]. This is the G-I axis: good fortune-ill fortune. Death and terrible poverty, sickness down here—great prosperity, wonderful health up there. Your average state of affairs here in the middle [<em>points to bottom, top, and middle of line respectively</em>].</p>
        
        <p>This is the B-E axis. B for beginning, E for entropy. Okay. Not every story has that very simple, very pretty shape that even a computer can understand [<em>draws horizontal line extending from middle of G-I axis</em>].</p>
        
        <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut1.jpg"><img alt="Vonnegut1.jpg" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/assets_c/2010/03/Vonnegut1-thumb-250x189-1098.jpg" width="250" height="189" class="mt-image-left" /></a></span></p>
        
        <p>Now let me give you a marketing tip. The people who can afford to buy books and magazines and go to the movies don’t like to hear about people who are poor or sick, so start your story up here [<em>indicates top of the G-I axis</em>]. You will see this story over and over again. People love it, and it is not copyrighted. The story is “Man in Hole,” but the story needn’t be about a man or a hole. It’s: somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again [<em>draws line A</em>]. It is not accidental that the line ends up higher than where it began. This is encouraging to readers.</p>
        
        <p>Another is called “Boy Meets Girl,” but this needn’t be about a boy meeting a girl [<em>begins drawing line B</em>]. It’s: somebody, an ordinary person, on a day like any other day, comes across something perfectly wonderful: “Oh boy, this is my lucky day!”  [<em>drawing line downward</em>]. “Shit!”  [<em>drawing line back up again</em>]. And gets back up again.</p>
        
        <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut2.jpg"><img alt="Vonnegut2.jpg" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/assets_c/2010/03/Vonnegut2-thumb-250x187-1101.jpg" width="250" height="187" class="mt-image-left" /></a></span></p>
        
        <p>Now, I don’t mean to intimidate you, but after being a chemist as an undergraduate at Cornell, after the war I went to the University of Chicago and studied anthropology, and eventually I took a masters degree in that field. Saul Bellow was in that same department, and neither one of us ever made a field trip. Although we certainly imagined some. I started going to the library in search of reports about ethnographers, preachers, and explorers—those imperialists—to find out what sorts of stories they’d collected from primitive people. It was a big mistake for me to take a degree in anthropology anyway, because I can’t stand primitive people—they’re so stupid. But anyway, I read these stories, one after another, collected from primitive people all over the world, and they were dead level, like the B-E axis here. So all right. Primitive people deserve to lose with their lousy stories. They really are backward. Look at the wonderful rise and fall of our stories.</p>
        
        <p>One of the most popular stories ever told starts down here [<em>begins line C below B-E axis</em>]. Who is this person who’s despondent? She’s a girl of about fifteen or sixteen whose mother had died, so why wouldn’t she be low? And her father got married almost immediately to a terrible battle-axe with two mean daughters. You’ve heard it?</p>
        
        <p>There’s to be a party at the palace. She has to help her two stepsisters and her dreadful stepmother get ready to go, but she herself has to stay home. Is she even sadder now? No, she’s already a broken-hearted little girl. The death of her mother is enough. Things can’t get any worse than that. So okay, they all leave for the party. Her fairy godmother shows up [<em>draws incremental rise</em>], gives her pantyhose, mascara, and a means of transportation to get to the party.</p>
        
        
        <p>And when she shows up she’s the belle of the ball [<em>draws line upward</em>]. She is so heavily made up that her relatives don’t even recognize her. Then the clock strikes twelve, as promised, and it’s all taken away again [<em>draws line downward</em>]. It doesn’t take long for a clock to strike twelve times, so she drops down. Does she drop down to the same level? Hell, no. No matter what happens after that she’ll remember when the prince was in love with her and she was the belle of the ball. So she poops along, at her considerably improved level, no matter what, and the shoe fits, and she becomes off-scale happy [<em>draws line upward and then infinity symbol</em>].</p>
        
        <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut3.jpg"><img alt="Vonnegut3.jpg" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/assets_c/2010/03/Vonnegut3-thumb-250x187-1103.jpg" width="250" height="187" class="mt-image-left" /></a></span></p>
        
        <p>Now there’s a Franz Kafka story [<em>begins line D toward bottom of G-I axis</em>]. A young man is rather unattractive and not very personable. He has disagreeable relatives and has had a lot of jobs with no chance of promotion. He doesn’t get paid enough to take his girl dancing or to go to the beer hall to have a beer with a friend. One morning he wakes up, it’s time to go to work again, and he has turned into a cockroach [<em>draws line downward and then infinity symbol</em>]. </p>
        
        <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut4.jpg"><img alt="Vonnegut4.jpg" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/assets_c/2010/03/Vonnegut4-thumb-250x203-1105.jpg" width="250" height="203" class="mt-image-left" /></a></span></p>
        
        <p>It’s a pessimistic story.</p>
        
        <p>The question is, does this system I’ve devised help us in the evaluation of literature? Perhaps a real masterpiece cannot be crucified on a cross of this design. How about <em>Hamlet</em>? It’s a pretty good piece of work I’d say. Is anybody going to argue that it isn’t? I don’t have to draw a new line, because Hamlet’s situation is the same as Cinderella’s, except that the sexes are reversed.</p>
        
        <p>His father has just died. He’s despondent. And right away his mother went and married his uncle, who’s a bastard. So Hamlet is going along on the same level as Cinderella when his friend Horatio comes up to him and says, “Hamlet, listen, there’s this thing up in the parapet, I think maybe you’d better talk to it. It’s your dad.” So Hamlet goes up and talks to this, you know, fairly substantial apparition there. And this thing says, “I’m your father, I was murdered, you gotta avenge me, it was your uncle did it, here’s how.”</p>
        
        <p>Well, was this good news or bad news? To this day we don’t know if that ghost was really Hamlet’s father. If you have messed around with Ouija boards, you know there are malicious spirits floating around, liable to tell you anything, and you shouldn’t believe them. Madame Blavatsky, who knew more about the spirit world than anybody else, said you are a fool to take any apparition seriously, because they are often malicious and they are frequently the souls of people who were murdered, were suicides, or were terribly cheated in life in one way or another, and they are out for revenge.</p>
        
        <p>So we don’t know whether this thing was really Hamlet’s father or if it was good news or bad news. And neither does Hamlet. But he says okay, I got a way to check this out. I’ll hire actors to act out the way the ghost said my father was murdered by my uncle, and I’ll put on this show and see what my uncle makes of it. So he puts on this show. And it’s not like Perry Mason. His uncle doesn’t go crazy and say, “I-I-you got me, you got me, I did it, I did it.” It flops. Neither good news nor bad news. After this flop Hamlet ends up talking with his mother when the drapes move, so he thinks his uncle is back there and he says, “All right, I am so sick of being so damn indecisive,” and he sticks his rapier through the drapery. Well, who falls out? This windbag, Polonius. This Rush Limbaugh. And Shakespeare regards him as a fool and quite disposable.</p>
        
        <p>You know, dumb parents think that the advice that Polonius gave to his kids when they were going away was what parents should always tell their kids, and it’s the dumbest possible advice, and Shakespeare even thought it was hilarious.</p>
        
        
        <p>“Neither a borrower nor a lender be.” But what else is life but endless lending and borrowing, give and take?</p>
        
        <p>“This above all, to thine own self be true.” Be an egomaniac!</p>
        
        <p>Neither good news nor bad news. Hamlet didn’t get arrested. He’s prince. He can kill anybody he wants. So he goes along, and finally he gets in a duel, and he’s killed. Well, did he go to heaven or did he go to hell? Quite a difference. Cinderella or Kafka’s cockroach? I don’t think Shakespeare believed in a heaven or hell any more than I do. And so we don’t know whether it’s good news or bad news.</p>
        
        <p>I have just demonstrated to you that Shakespeare was as poor a storyteller as any Arapaho.</p>
        
        <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/images/Vonnegut5.jpg"><img alt="Vonnegut5.jpg" src="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/assets_c/2010/03/Vonnegut5-thumb-250x192-1107.jpg" width="250" height="192" class="mt-image-left" /></a></span></p>
        
        <p>But there’s a reason we recognize <em>Hamlet</em> as a masterpiece: it’s that Shakespeare told us the truth, and people so rarely tell us the truth in this rise and fall here [<em>indicates blackboard</em>]. The truth is, we know so little about life, we don’t really know what the good news is and what the bad news is.</p>
        
        <p>And if I die—God forbid—I would like to go to heaven to ask somebody in charge up there, “Hey, what was the good news and what was the bad news?”</p>

        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>The plane slowed and leveled</strong> out about a mile aboveground. Up ahead, the Viennese castle glowed like a fairy tale palace. When the pilot gave the thumbs-up, Gerald Blanchard looked down, checked his parachute straps, and jumped into the darkness. He plummeted for a second, then pulled his cord, slowing to a nice descent toward the tiled roof. It was early June 1998, and the evening wind was warm. If it kept cooperating, Blanchard would touch down directly above the room that held the Koechert Diamond Pearl. He steered his parachute toward his target.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>A couple of days earlier, Blanchard had appeared to be just another twentysomething on vacation with his wife and her wealthy father. The three of them were taking a six-month grand European tour: London, Rome, Barcelona, the French Riviera, Vienna. When they stopped at the <a href="http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/home.html">Schloss Schönbrunn</a>, the Austrian equivalent of Versailles, his father-in-law’s VIP status granted them a special preview peek at a highly prized piece from a private collection. And there it was: In a cavernous room, in an alarmed case, behind bulletproof glass, on a weight-sensitive pedestal — a delicate but dazzling <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2943269.ece">10-pointed star</a> of diamonds fanned around one monstrous pearl. Five seconds after laying eyes on it, Blanchard knew he would try to take it.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The docent began to describe the history of the Koechert Diamond Pearl, better known as the Sisi Star — it was one of many similar pieces specially crafted for <a href="http://www.royal-magazin.de/austria/sisi-diamond-stars.htm">Empress Elisabeth</a> to be worn in her magnificently long and lovely braids. Sisi, as she was affectionately known, was assassinated 100 years ago. Only two stars remain, and it has been 75 years since the public had a glimpse of…</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard wasn’t listening. He was noting the motion sensors in the corner, the type of screws on the case, the large windows nearby. To hear Blanchard tell it, he has a savantlike ability to assess security flaws, like a criminal Rain Man who involuntarily sees risk probabilities at every turn. And the numbers came up good for the star. Blanchard knew he couldn’t fence the piece, which he did hear the guide say was worth $2 million. Still, he found the thing mesmerizing and the challenge irresistible.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>He began to work immediately, videotaping every detail of the star’s chamber. (He even coyly shot the “No Cameras” sign near the jewel case.) He surreptitiously used a key to loosen the screws when the staff moved on to the next room, unlocked the windows, and determined that the motion sensors would allow him to move — albeit very slowly — inside the castle. He stopped at the souvenir shop and bought a replica of the Sisi Star to get a feel for its size. He also noted the armed guards stationed at every entrance and patrolling the halls.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>But the roof was unguarded, and it so happened that one of the skills Blanchard had picked up in his already long criminal career was skydiving. He had also recently befriended a German pilot who was game for a mercenary sortie and would help Blanchard procure a parachute. Just one night after his visit to the star, Blanchard was making his descent to the roof.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><a href="http://www.skydivingmagazine.com/faq.htm">Aerial approaches</a> are a tricky business, though, and Blanchard almost overshot the castle, slowing himself just enough by skidding along a pitched gable. Sliding down the tiles, arms and legs flailing for a grip, Blanchard managed to save himself from falling four stories by grabbing a railing at the roof’s edge. For a moment, he lay motionless. Then he took a deep breath, unhooked the chute, retrieved a rope from his pack, wrapped it around a marble column, and lowered himself down the side of the building.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Carefully, Blanchard entered through the window he had unlocked the previous day. He knew there was a chance of encountering guards. But the Schloss Schönbrunn was a big place, with more than 1,000 rooms. He liked the odds. If he heard guards, he figured, he would disappear behind the massive curtains.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The nearby rooms were silent as Blanchard slowly approached the display and removed the already loosened screws, carefully using a butter knife to hold in place the two long rods that would trigger the alarm system. The real trick was ensuring that the spring-loaded mechanism the star was sitting on didn’t register that the weight above it had changed. Of course, he had that covered, too: He reached into his pocket and deftly replaced Elisabeth’s bejeweled hairpin with the gift-store fake.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Within minutes, the Sisi Star was in Blanchard’s pocket and he was rappelling down a back wall to the garden, taking the rope with him as he slipped from the grounds. When the star was dramatically unveiled to the public the next day, Blanchard returned to watch visitors gasp at the sheer beauty of a cheap replica. And when his parachute was later found in a trash bin, no one connected it to the star, because no one yet knew it was missing. It was two weeks before anyone realized that the jewelry had disappeared.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Later, the Sisi Star rode inside the respirator of some scuba gear back to his home base in Canada, where Blanchard would assemble what prosecutors later called, for lack of a better term, the <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=105x6116058">Blanchard Criminal Organization</a>. Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of surveillance and electronics, Blanchard became a criminal mastermind. The star was the heist that transformed him from a successful and experienced thief into a criminal virtuoso.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“Cunning, clever, conniving, and creative,” as one prosecutor would call him, Blanchard eluded the police for years. But eventually he made a mistake. And that mistake would take two officers from the modest police force of Winnipeg, Canada, on a wild ride of high tech capers across Africa, Canada, and Europe. Says Mitch McCormick, one of those Winnipeg investigators, “We had never seen anything like it.”</p>&#13;

        &#13;
        <p><strong>Blanchard pulled off</strong> his first heist when he was a 6-year-old living with his single mother in Winnipeg. The family couldn’t afford milk, and one day, after a long stretch of dry cereal, the boy spotted some recently delivered bottles on a neighbor’s porch. “I snuck over there between cars like I was on some kind of mission,” he says. “And no one saw me take it.” His heart was pounding, and the milk was somehow sweeter than usual. “After that,” he says, “I was hooked.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard moved to Nebraska, started going by his middle name, Daniel, and became an accomplished thief. He didn’t look the part — slim, short, and bespectacled, he resembled a young Bill Gates — but he certainly played it, getting into enough trouble to land in reform school. “The way I met Daniel was that he stole my classroom VCR,” recalls Randy Flanagan, one of Blanchard’s teachers. Flanagan thought he might be able to straighten out the soft-spoken and polite kid, so he took Blanchard under his wing in his home-mechanics class.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“He was a real natural in there,” Flanagan says. Blanchard’s mother remembers that even as a toddler he could take anything apart. Despite severe dyslexia and a speech impediment, Blanchard “was an absolute genius with his hands,” the teacher recalls. In Flanagan’s class, Blanchard learned construction, woodworking, model building, and automotive mechanics. The two bonded, and Flanagan became a father figure to Blanchard, driving him to and from school and looking out for him. “He could see that I had talent,” Blanchard says. “And he wanted me to put it to good use.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Flanagan had seen many hopeless kids straighten out — “You never know when something’s going to change forever for someone,” he says — and he still hoped that would happen to Blanchard. “But Daniel was the type of kid who would spend more time trying to cheat on a test than it would have taken to study for it,” Flanagan says with a laugh.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>In fact, by early in his high school years, Blanchard had already abandoned his after-school job stocking groceries to pursue more lucrative opportunities, like fencing tens of thousands of dollars in goods stolen by department store employees he had managed to befriend. “I could just tell who would work with me,” he says. “It’s a gift, I guess.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard began mastering the workings of myriad mechanical devices and electronics. He became obsessed with cameras and surveillance: documenting targets, his own exploits, and his huge piles of money. Befitting a young tech enthusiast, he emptied an entire RadioShack one Easter Sunday. At age 16, he bought a house with more than $100,000 in cash. (He hired a lawyer to handle the money and sign the deal on his behalf.) When he moved in, Blanchard told his mother that the home belonged to a friend. “She looked the other way,” Blanchard says. “And I tried to keep it all from her.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Around this time, Blanchard was arrested for theft. He did several months behind bars and was released into Flanagan’s custody after the older man vouched for him at a hearing. “He was great with our own kids,” Flanagan says. “And I still thought he might come around.” But Blanchard’s burgeoning criminal career was hard to ignore, as he often flaunted his ill-gotten gains. “I wasn’t surprised when the FBI came knocking one day,” Flanagan says. “He’d pull out a fistful of hundreds and peel one off to pay for pizza.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>In April 1993, Blanchard was <a href="http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/23631">nabbed by the cops</a> in Council Bluffs, Iowa, for a suspected car arson and brought back to police headquarters. “They kept me in the interrogation room past midnight,” Blanchard says. “And at a certain point, I managed to sneak into the next room and slip through the tiles into the ceiling.” Undetected, he heard the cops run down the hall, thinking he’d gone out the fire escape. After waiting a couple of hours, Blanchard lowered himself down into the mostly empty station, stole a police coat, badge, radio, and revolver. After leaving a single bullet on the desk of his interrogator, he took the elevator to the main floor and strolled right past the front desk on his way out of the station. He hitchhiked at dawn back to Omaha on the back of a motorcycle, holding his purloined police cap down in the wind. “Why are you wearing a uniform?” the driver asked. “Costume party,” Blanchard said as the sun came up. “Really fun time.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The next day, Blanchard was re-apprehended by a SWAT team, which had to use flash grenades to extricate him from his mother’s attic. But he surprised the cops by escaping yet again, this time from the back of a police cruiser. “They got out of the car and left the keys,” Blanchard says. “There was no barrier, so I fiddled with the cuffs until I got my hands in front of me, locked the doors, slipped up front, and put it in gear.” The authorities gave chase until Blanchard swerved into a steak-house parking lot, fled on foot, and was finally recaptured.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>This time, Blanchard served four years and his sentence came with a deportation order attached. In March 1997, he was released to his Canadian homeland and barred from returning to the US for five years.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“After that,” Flanagan says, “I heard from Daniel once or twice a year, thanking me for what I had done for him.” Blanchard sent pictures of himself vacationing around the world, on exclusive beaches, posing in front of Viennese castles. He said he had his own security business. “I wanted that to be true,” Flanagan says. “But I had a hunch he was more likely in the anti-security business.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>In 2001, Blanchard was driving</strong> around Edmonton when he saw a new branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATB_Financial">Alberta Treasury</a> bank going up. His internal algorithm calculated low risk, and he began to case the target meticulously. It had been three years since the Sisi Star theft, and it was time to try something big and new.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>As the bank was being built, Blanchard frequently sneaked inside — sometimes at night, sometimes in broad daylight, disguised as a delivery person or construction worker. There’s less security before the money shows up, and that allowed Blanchard to plant various surveillance devices in the ATM room. He knew when the cash machines were installed and what kind of locks they had. He ordered the same locks online and reverse engineered them at home. Later he returned to the Alberta Treasury to disassemble, disable, and remount the locks.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The take at this bank was a modest 60 grand, but the thrill mattered more than the money anyway. Blanchard’s ambition flowered, as did his technique. As Flanagan had observed, Blanchard always wanted to beat the system, and he was getting better at it.</p>&#13;

        &#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard targeted a half-dozen banks over the next few years. He’d get in through the air-conditioning ductwork, at times contorting his body to fit inside really tight spaces. Other times, he would pick the locks. If there were <a href="http://www.smartec.nl/infrared_sensor.htm">infrared sensors</a>, he’d use IR goggles to see the beams. Or he’d simply fool the sensor by blocking the beam with a lead film bag.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>He assembled an arsenal of tools: night-vision cameras, long-range lenses, high-gain antennas that could pick up the feeds from the audio and video recorders he hid inside a bank, scanners programmed with the encryption keys for police frequencies. He always had a burglary kit on hand containing ropes, uniforms, cameras, and microphones. In the Edmonton branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, which he hit in 2002, he installed a metal panel near the AC ducts to create a secret crawl space that he could disappear into if surprised by police.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Such evasive action was never required, however, in part because Blanchard had also memorized the mechanics of the Mas-Hamilton and La Gard locks that <a href="http://www.kaba-mas.com/a.php?page=home">many banks used</a> for their ATMs. (These are big, complicated contraptions, and when police later interrogated Blanchard, they presented him with a Mas-Hamilton lock in dozens of pieces. He stunned them by reassembling it in 40 seconds.)</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard also learned how to turn himself into someone else. Sometimes it was just a matter of donning a yellow hard hat from Home Depot. But it could also be more involved. Eventually, Blanchard used legitimate baptism and marriage certificates — filled out with his assumed names — to obtain real driver’s licenses. He would even take driving tests, apply for passports, or enroll in college classes under one of his many aliases: James Gehman, Daniel Wall, or Ron Aikins. With the help of makeup, glasses, or dyed hair, Blanchard gave James, Daniel, Ron, and the others each a different look.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Over the years, Blanchard procured and stockpiled IDs and uniforms from various security companies and even law enforcement agencies. Sometimes, just for fun and to see whether it would work, he pretended to be a reporter so he could hang out with celebrities. He created VIP passes and applied for press cards so he could go to NHL playoff games or take a spin around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with racing legend Mario Andretti. He met the prince of Monaco at a yacht race in Monte Carlo and interviewed Christina Aguilera at one of her concerts.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>That’s where, in July 2000, Blanchard met Angela James. She had flowing black hair and claimed to work for Ford Models. They got along right away, and Blanchard was elated when she gave him her number. He sensed that the teenager was “down with crime” — someone he could count on for help.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard liked having a sidekick. James was a fun, outgoing party animal who had plenty of free time. She eventually began helping Blanchard on bank jobs. They’d tag-team on daylight reconnaissance, where her striking looks provided a distraction while Blanchard gathered information. At night, she’d be the lookout.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Though they were never involved romantically, James and Blanchard traveled together around the world, stopping in the Caribbean to stash his loot in offshore accounts. They camped out at resorts in Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos islands, depositing money in $10,000 increments into some of Blanchard’s 13 pseudonymously held accounts. The money in the offshore accounts was to pay for his jet-setting lifestyle. The money back in Canada would bankroll his real estate transactions. The funds sitting in Europe were there, well, in case anything happened to him.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>After midnight</strong> on Saturday, May 15, 2004, as the northern prairie winter was finally giving way to spring, Blanchard walked up to the front door of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in the Mega Centre, a suburban development in Winnipeg. He quickly jimmied the lock, slipped inside, and locked the door behind him. It was a brand-new branch that was set to open for business on Monday, and Blanchard knew that the cash machines had been loaded on Friday.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Thorough as ever, Blanchard had spent many previous nights infiltrating the bank to do recon or to tamper with the locks while James acted as lookout, scanning the vicinity with binoculars and providing updates via a scrambled-band walkie-talkie. He had put a transmitter behind an electrical outlet, a pinhole video camera in a thermostat, and a cheap baby monitor behind the wall. He had even mounted handles on the drywall panels so he could remove them to enter and exit the ATM room. Blanchard had also taken detailed measurements of the room and set up a dummy version in a friend’s nearby machine shop. With practice, he had gotten his ATM-cracking routine down to where he needed only 90 seconds after the alarm tripped to finish and escape with his score.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>As Blanchard approached, he saw that the door to the ATM room was unlocked and wide open. Sometimes you get lucky. All he had to do was walk inside.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>From here he knew the drill by heart. There were seven machines, each with four drawers. He set to work quickly, using just the right technique to spring the machines open without causing any telltale damage. Well rehearsed, Blanchard wheeled out boxes full of cash and several money counters, locked the door behind him, and headed to a van he had parked nearby.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Eight minutes after Blanchard broke into the first ATM, the Winnipeg Police Service arrived in response to the alarm. However, the officers found the doors locked and assumed the alarm had been an error. As the police pronounced the bank secure, Blanchard was zipping away with more than half a million dollars.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The following morning was a puzzler for authorities. There were no indications of damage to the door, no fingerprints, and no surveillance recordings — Blanchard had stolen the hard drives that stored footage from the bank’s cameras. Moreover, Blanchard’s own surveillance equipment was still transmitting from inside the ATM room, so before he skipped town, he could listen in on investigators. He knew their names; he knew their leads. He would call both the bank manager’s cell phone and the police, posing as an anonymous informant who had been involved in the heist and was swindled out of his share. It was the contractors, he’d say. Or the Brinks guy. Or the maintenance people. His tips were especially convincing because he had a piece of inside information: One of the bank’s ATMs was left untouched. Blanchard had done that on purpose to make it easier to sow confusion.</p>&#13;

        &#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p>With the cops outmatched and chasing red herrings, the Winnipeg bank job looked like a perfect crime. Then officials got a call from a vigilant employee at a nearby Walmart, which shared a large parking lot with the bank. He had been annoyed at people leaving cars there, so he took it upon himself to scan the lot. On the night of the break-in, he spotted a blue Dodge Caravan next to the bank. Seeing a dolly and other odd equipment inside, he took down the license plate number. Police ran it. The vehicle had been rented from Avis by one Gerald Daniel Blanchard.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>Blanchard’s use</strong> of his real name was as careless as the fingerprints police found inside the getaway van recovered by the rental company. Soon the cops were on his tail.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Because of the heist’s sophistication, the investigation fell to <a href="http://www.winnipeg.ca/police/CrimeStoppers/major_crimes/">Winnipeg’s Major Crimes unit</a>. But Blanchard — now divorced and living with his girlfriend, Lynette Tien — learned that he had become a suspect, so he stayed out of their sights. Two years passed, and many of the investigators who had dealt with the initial leads retired or were transferred.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The case went cold until early 2006, when Mitch McCormick, a veteran officer in his fifties, started working on major crimes and decided to take a look at the unsolved robbery. Intrigued, he called his longtime colleague Larry Levasseur, a wiretap ace who had just been transferred to the Commercial Crimes division.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>One night in early February, McCormick and Levasseur sat down at the King’s Head bar, a favorite local police haunt. Levasseur went through several pints of amber ale, and McCormick had his usual double rye and a Coke tall. McCormick filled him in on the Blanchard leads and gave him the case file to take home.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The two were interested, but McCormick’s boss was skeptical. Why spend money chasing a criminal who was committing most of his crimes outside their jurisdiction? Eventually, though, the two stubborn cops made such a fuss that the department brass relented. “But we got no resources and had to put together a task force out of thin air,” McCormick says. “It was like the set of <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Miller">Barney Miller</a></cite>. We knew it was bad when we had to buy our own Post-its.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>They quickly started filling up those Post-its and arranging them on a corkboard, mapping Blanchard’s sprawling network. The case was overwhelming, but they eventually unraveled his tangle of 32 false names. Their preliminary checks also showed that Blanchard was a person of interest in many crimes, including the unsolved theft of the Sisi Star nearly 10 years earlier. They assembled roughly 275 pages of documentation, enough to persuade a judge to let them tap Blanchard’s 18 phones. Now they were in business. They were taking a professional flier on this case. They dubbed their investigation Project Kite.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>Usually wiretaps</strong> are <a href="http://www.canadalawbook.ca/catalogue_detail.cfm?ProductID=191">a waiting game</a>; cops will listen to secretive organized crime syndicates for years, hoping for one little slip. But Blanchard was surprisingly loose-lipped. The second weekend the wires went live, McCormick and Levasseur heard him directing a team of underlings in a product-return fraud at a Best Buy. More scams followed. They heard him wheeling and dealing in real estate. They listened in as he planned his next bank job. They learned about a vast network of sophisticated crime. For a smart criminal, McCormick and Levasseur thought, this guy sure did talk a lot.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Then, on November 16, 2006, Blanchard got a particularly intriguing call.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“Hello, Danny,” a man with a thick British accent said. “Are you ready? I have a job for you. How soon can you get to Cairo?”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>McCormick and Levasseur listened with astonishment as Blanchard immediately set about recruiting his own small team to meet up with another group in Egypt. Blanchard referred to his contact as the Boss — he couldn’t pronounce his real name — and explained to his cohorts that there was money to be made with this guy.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>James was in. But her parents were in town visiting, and her mother didn’t want her to go. James put her mom on the phone so Blanchard could talk the woman into giving her daughter permission to join him in a criminal escapade across the globe. “We’re going to make a lot of money,” he said. “But don’t worry. Everything will be fine.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Several of his regular guys couldn’t make it, so Blanchard called his neighbor, a Congolese immigrant named Balume Kashongwe. When Blanchard explained the job, Kashongwe volunteered right away. With his team assembled, Blanchard thought, “This is going to be easy. What could go wrong?” Just a few hours after the Boss’ call, Blanchard, Kashongwe, and James were in the air, en route to Cairo.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>Blanchard had first</strong> met the Boss a few months earlier in London at an electronics store. He could tell they were kindred spirits by a glance at the Boss’ purchases: eight DVR recorders. Blanchard knew you didn’t buy a load like that for anything but surveillance. The two struck up a conversation.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Later that day, a car arrived to take Blanchard to a London café, where the Boss and a dozen Kurdish henchmen, most from northern Iraq, were waiting in the basement, smoking hookahs. The Boss filled Blanchard in on his operation, which spanned Europe and the Middle East and included various criminal activities, including counterfeiting and fraud. The latest endeavor was called skimming: gleaning active debit and credit card numbers by patching into the ISDN lines that companies use to process payments. The group manufactured counterfeit cards magnetized and embossed with the stolen numbers and then used them to withdraw the maximum daily limits before the fraud was reported. It was a lucrative venture for the Boss’ network, which funneled a portion of its take to Kurdish separatists in Iraq.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Living up to his new nickname, the Boss gave Blanchard a trial job: taking 25 cards to Canada to retrieve cash. Blanchard returned to London with $60,000, and the Boss was pleased. He found the younger man charming and steady as well. “We have something big coming,” he told Blanchard over dinner at a Kurdish restaurant. “I’ll keep you posted.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>With that job now at hand, Blanchard’s crew arrived in Egypt and checked into the Cairo Marriott Hotel &amp; Omar Khayyam Casino, settling into a couple of suites with sweeping views of the Nile. The next day, three men Blanchard remembered from the London cafè showed up. They brought roughly 1,000 pirated cards, which the group immediately started using in teams of two. Kashongwe and the Kurds from London blended in easily. Blanchard and James bought burkas in the souk as disguises. The Boss directed operations from London.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>They went from ATM to ATM for 12 hours a day, withdrawing Egyptian pounds and stuffing the bills into backpacks and suitcases. Blanchard and James folded their cash into pouches hidden beneath the burkas. And as usual, Blanchard filmed the entire adventure: the wandering through Cairo’s Byzantine streets, the downtime in the city, the money pouring in.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <!--nextpage-->&#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Back in their bare-bones Winnipeg office, McCormick and Levasseur were monitoring their target’s email accounts and calls back to Tien, who was managing travel arrangements and other administrative details from Blanchard’s condo in Vancouver. The Canadian cops were stunned. They never imagined they’d come across anything this big. They learned about the loot piling up 4 feet high in the suites at the Marriott. And then they learned that everything had gone to hell.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>In the course of a week,</strong> the team collected the equivalent of more than $2 million. But the individual ATM payouts were small, so after a couple of days Blanchard sent Kashongwe south to Nairobi, Kenya, with 50 cards to find more-generous machines. Kashongwe had no cell phone, though, and he went suspiciously incommunicado. Soon it became clear that Kashongwe was AWOL. Blanchard wasn’t happy. And neither was the Boss.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard was in over his head. In his many years of crime, guns had never been involved. The Boss, however, seemed inclined to change that. Blanchard promised to track down Kashongwe. “Good,” the Boss said. “Otherwise, we’ll find him. And he won’t be happy when we do.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>McCormick and Levasseur listened to the calls in and out of Cairo as temperatures rose. They could hear Blanchard calling Tien back in Vancouver, trying desperately to reach Kashongwe. He called Kashongwe’s sister in Brussels and his brother in Ottawa. He sounded frantic at times. But Blanchard had no luck; Kashongwe had vanished.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Things took another turn for the worse when the Boss told Blanchard he couldn’t leave Cairo until the missing cards were accounted for. Two more men arrived to “keep an eye on things.” The Marriott suites had turned into a hostage scene.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>But Blanchard’s natural charm worked on the Boss, too. He took full responsibility, promised to personally pay back Kashongwe’s share, and calmly argued that James didn’t have anything to do with the double cross. The Boss eventually told his men to let James go. Then he agreed to let Blanchard travel to London to smooth things out in person. “I’m pretty honest about that kind of thing,” Blanchard says. “And the Boss could see that I was taking responsibility for my guy.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The two decided to set aside the Kashongwe problem in the interest of business. The Boss’ men would meet Blanchard back in Canada with a new batch of cards. “After all,” Blanchard says, “why fight when there was more money to be made?”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>On December 3, 2006,</strong> Blanchard landed in Vancouver, where he immediately rented a car and drove straight to a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, 65 miles east in Chilliwack. He’d started prepping to burglarize the bank before his trip. The Kashongwe fiasco ended up nearly costing Blanchard money, and now he was after a sizable payday. Chilliwack was good for $800,000, he figured, and he would work through the holidays to get it done.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>McCormick and Levasseur had both been on duty during the holidays before, but never had a case so consumed them. They were spending 18-hour days in their makeshift headquarters or at the King’s Head, poring over transcripts and evidence. They got no overtime pay. The strain grew, as did the pressure from higher-ups.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Lucky for them, Blanchard’s disarray was compounding his mistakes. As soon as he touched down, McCormick and Levasseur picked up Blanchard live, discussing Cairo, his next bank, and the potential whereabouts of Kashongwe. While Blanchard was en route to Chilliwack, they listened to him and the Boss discuss details about the arrival of a team in Montreal the next day.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>McCormick and Levasseur called officials at the Montreal airport with names and flight information. As the targets strode through the airport, the cops swarmed in. The team was detained, and police seized dozens of blank credit cards, a card writer, and computers overflowing with evidence that filled in the blanks on the Cairo operation. To top it off, the hard drives also contained some of Blanchard’s comprehensive amateur crime video of that job. Now the police could not only hear him talking about crimes, they could see him committing them.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>The Boss phoned</strong> the very next day, panicked. But the call caught Blanchard at an inopportune moment. “I can’t talk right now,” Blanchard whispered. “I’m doing my thing inside the bank right now.” It was 12:30 am, and Blanchard was crawling through the bank’s ductwork.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“Listen, my guys got arrested in the airport, and I need to find out why,” the Boss said. Blanchard was making his way painstakingly through the air vents, en route to the ATM room. His earpiece was taped in and the phone was on auto-answer, in case he got a call that the police were nearby. “What’s going on with my guys in Montreal?” the Boss demanded. “They got pulled in!”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“I have no idea,” Blanchard said softly. “But it’s too much of a coincidence that customs knew. The phones must be tapped.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The Boss pressed on, asking for news about Kashongwe, but Blanchard interrupted. “I’m looking down. There’s a security guard down there right now,” he breathed. He was deep into the building, making it hard to shimmy his way out in case he needed an emergency escape. “I have too much invested in this job,” he said. “I have to go.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“We need to fix this, Danny,” the Boss said.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>As Blanchard whispered back, McCormick and Levasseur were triangulating the call’s location. Now they knew Blanchard was targeting Chilliwack’s Bank of Nova Scotia. In late January, investigators from Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver as well as provincial police and the Mounties had joined McCormick and Levasseur’s small operation. “Project Kite was ready to be reeled in,” McCormick says.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <!--nextpage-->&#13;
        &#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>At 4 am on</strong> January 23, 2007, more than a dozen SWAT team members swarmed Blanchard’s Vancouver condo, where they found Blanchard and Tien. Several other search warrants were executed simultaneously across Canada, turning up half a dozen accomplices, including Angela James and Blanchard’s cousin Dale Fedoruk.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard was busted. At his various residences and storage facilities, police confiscated 10 pallets of material: 60,000 documents, cash in various currencies, smoke bombs, firearms, and 300 electronic devices, including commercial card printers, card readers, and all manner of surveillance equipment. In his condo, police discovered a hidden room stocked with burglary kits and well-organized, itemized documentation of all Blanchard’s fake identities. He was initially charged with 41 crimes, ranging from fraud to possession of instruments for forging credit cards.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The Boss called Blanchard in jail on the prison phone. “Why you, Danny?” he asked. “Why would little Winnipeg go to all that trouble? You must have upset the establishment. It’s like we say in England: You fuck with the Queen, and they fuck with you.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>As McCormick and Levasseur listened in, Blanchard said it wasn’t the establishment, or the Queen. “It was these Keystone Kops out here in Winnipeg.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p><strong>Blanchard says</strong> that he could have escaped from jail again, but there was no point. The police had all the evidence, including 120 video- and audiotapes detailing everything. They’d just find him again, and he was tired of running anyhow.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard refused to make statements about any of his associates, but he eventually decided to cooperate with authorities about his own case. “He’s a flamboyant guy,” McCormick says. “And an extrovert, recording everything. Some part of him just wanted to tell his story.” He had another incentive, too: Revealing his methods, which would help the banking industry improve its security practices, could earn him a lighter prison sentence.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The first day that Levasseur sat down with Blanchard in Vancouver, the investigator felt like he “was talking to a wall.” But in later interviews, Blanchard became more courteous and helpful. Finally, after some negotiations through his lawyer, Blanchard offered to take them to the Sisi Star. “It’s right here in my grandmother’s basement in Winnipeg,” he said. Blanchard had tried to steer clear of his family since his arrest; he didn’t want to embarrass them further. But now he had to call. “I need to come to the house,” he said. “And I’m bringing the police.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard, in handcuffs and leg shackles, hugged his grandmother at the door and took McCormick and Levasseur directly into the basement. He disappeared into a crawl space with Levasseur. It was quiet except for the sound of them grappling with the insulation. Eventually, Levasseur removed a square of Styrofoam and pulled out the star.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>They brought it out into the light, where the detectives marveled at the beauty of the piece. They’d never seen anything like it. That kicked off nearly a month of debriefing. The cops had gotten some stuff right, but Blanchard set them straight on the rest. “Never in policing does the bad guy tell you, ‘Here’s how I did it, down to the last detail,’” McCormick says. “And that’s what he did.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>After spending so much time chasing Blanchard — and then talking to him — McCormick and Levasseur developed a grudging regard for his abilities. And Blanchard grew to admire their relentless investigation. Like a cornered hacker who trades his black hat for white, Blanchard took on a new challenge: working the system from the inside. He provided such good information that McCormick and Levasseur were able to put together an eight-hour presentation for law enforcement and banking professionals. “When those guys hear what Blanchard told us,” McCormick says, “you can hear their assholes pucker shut.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard’s full participation came under consideration when he pled guilty to 16 charges on November 7, 2007. He agreed to sell his four condos and pay restitution to the Canadian government. And he was willing to take a longer sentence for himself in exchange for leniency toward his coaccused, whom he refused to testify against. None of his partners served jail time.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Blanchard also surprised the court by having his lawyer issue an unusual statement: an expression of gratitude for being arrested. “My client wishes to recognize that this huge lie that he had been living could now finally fall apart.” It added that Blanchard was looking forward to moving on. “He recognizes that the men and women of the Winnipeg Police Service made that all possible.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>Instead of the maximum of 164 years, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/11/07/blanchard-charges.html">Blanchard got eight</a>. And then last summer, after serving less than two, he was released into carefully guarded probation. He now lives in a Vancouver halfway house, where he is prohibited from going anywhere near certain types of surveillance equipment and talking to any of his former associates. One of the people he can call is Randy Flanagan, his old mentor from high school.</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>“He filled me in about the past 10 years,” Flanagan says. “I was surprised, but not that surprised, about what our little former son had been up to.” Blanchard told Flanagan he wanted to turn his life around. Working with McCormick and Levasseur had convinced him that he could become a consultant to the banks. “Who knows?” Flanagan says. “Maybe he will get that security business he talked about off the ground after all.”</p>&#13;
        &#13;
        <p>The judge had a similar thought during Blanchard’s plea hearing. The banks “should hire him and pay him a million dollars a year,” he said. And right before sentencing, the judge turned directly to Blanchard. “I think that you have a great future ahead of you if you wish to pursue an honest style of life,” he said. “Although I’m not prepared to sign a letter of reference.”</p>&#13;

        <div><h1>what you loved when you were nine or ten « fenced lot</h1><div class="snap_preview" readability="16"><p>There’s a beautiful passage early in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Walter-Murch-Editing-Film/dp/0375709827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269447251&amp;sr=1-1">The Conversations</a> (a long rambling interview between film/sound editor Walter Murch and writer Michael Ondaatje), where Murch is talking about how intoxicating it was to play with sound when he was nine or ten. He got a cassette tape recorder when they were very new, and would make strange noises by dragging the mic over surfaces, and by recording sounds from out of his (NYC) window. Then he realized he could chop the tape and reassemble it.</p>
        <p>“I’ve found that your chances for happiness are increased if you wind up doing something that is a reflection of what you loved most when you were somewhere between nine and eleven years old. At that age, you know enough of the world to have opinions about things, but you’re not old enough yet to be overly influenced by the crowd or by what other people are doing or what you think you “should” be doing. If what you do later on ties into that reservoir in some way, then you are nurturing some essential part of yourself.” [pg. 8-10]</p>
        <p>What I remember of that age is that I loved reading, lying, and making things. The lying wasn’t petty, it was rather of the fish stories and tall tales variety. I met a woman recently who I had known for just a couple of years at that age. Her clearest memories of me had to do with the lies, the elaborate and pleasurably accepted storytelling.</p>
        <p>Happiness as a byproduct of genuine passion, genuineness measured as a relationship to the unmediated passions of childhood.</p>
        <p>What did you love when you were nine or ten–how is it reflected (or not) in what you do now?</p>

        <div><h1>Shouts &amp; Murmurs: 1992 House : The New Yorker</h1><div id="articletext" readability="99">
                        
                            <p class="descender">I<i>ntroduction:</i></p> 
        <p>The assignment for Mrs. Stanfill’s eighth-grade social-studies class was to pick a year in U.S. history and live for a week as if it were that year, without any of the conveniences available in today’s modern society. I chose 1992, and for extra credit I persuaded my family to participate in the experiment along with me. Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992. A postage stamp cost twenty-nine cents, and Whitey (sp?) Houston had a No. 1 song with “I Will Always Love You,” from a movie starring someone named Kevin Costner, on whom my mother apparently had a major crush.</p>
        
        <p><i>Scientific controls:</i></p>
        <p>My brother Chris was the most reluctant to participate in the project, as he is way obsessed with the new Maroon 5 CD that he downloaded and didn’t like having to listen to crud like Billy Ray Cyrus and Boyz II Men for the duration of the control period. He has a massive DVD collection, which was out of bounds, too, given that DVDs had not been invented in the olden days of 1992. Though Chris has an abiding attachment to one of the girls on “The Real World: Philadelphia,” I told him that, for the sake of historical verisimilitude, he had to learn to live without her—and TiVo or his iPod—for a week. </p>
        <p>My stepdad Larry’s reaction to the assignment was interesting. He said that maybe he’d go out of town to play golf for the week of the experiment because he wasn’t actually “in the picture” in 1992. My mom nixed that suggestion. </p>
        <p>Since the Internet was not in common use back then, Larry needed to check his stocks in the newspaper, which he had to start buying at Starbucks because he usually reads the news online. Thank God Starbucks was around in 1992. (I think. Not sure, and, under the terms of the experiment, I couldn’t Google it.) But I do know that he couldn’t order his usual caramel macchiato, because evidently in 1992 Starbucks barely even served coffee, let alone specialty drinks!!!! </p>
        <p>My mom had a “procedure” scheduled for the week of the project and asked if I would make an exception for her, because my cousin Sharon’s bat mitzvah was less than a month away and my mom wanted to make sure she looked O.K. in the pictures. It’s too bad, because they definitely had bat mitzvahs and photography in 1992. But Botox was not readily available. </p>
        <p>So, to keep the integrity of the research project intact, I denied her request and called Dr. Mussman (on a landline—duh!) to cancel her appointment. By the time she found out and called Dr. Mussman back, the slot was filled, and my mom and I became engaged in a significant altercation. As domestic conflict no doubt existed in 1992, this worked well within the parameters of the experiment. My mother wanted to punish me by depriving me of something that I care about, but just about everything that’s important to me was basically already off limits for the week anyway.</p>
        <p>I learned that one of the biggest hardships endured by people back in 1992 was not being able to use cell phones. At first, I had thought that maybe I could just cut back on the number of calls I made, thinking that usage plans were more limited. However, my research (at the library!) unearthed the fact that cell phones really were not in widespread use back then; there were only humongous car-phone versions, prevalent among early executives in the hip-hop industry.</p>
        <p>Attending school for a week without my cell phone aroused feelings of depression. It seemed like everyone around me was text-messaging each other, and after a while I became convinced that they were text-messaging about me. I felt really humiliated, and it made me appreciate the world I live in today. </p>
        <p><i>Research segment:</i></p>
        <p>Not having the use of a cell phone piqued my curiosity regarding how schoolchildren communicated all those years ago. Since my mother was not speaking to me and Larry wasn’t around (he did end up going to Myrtle Beach), I turned to primary sources (in the form of classic cinema) for answers. I found “The Breakfast Club” and “Pretty in Pink” in the library—on <i>videotape</i>. Through studying these movies, I learned that back in the eighties and nineties students would hand-write things on little pieces of paper called “notes” and try to pass them to each other in class without getting caught.</p>
        <p>Upon my return to school, no one wanted to engage in this practice with me because they were all text-messaging each other (probably about me).</p>
        
        <p><i>Basic survival observations:</i></p>
        <p>During the period of the experiment, my family subsisted on bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes, just as people did before the turn of the century. My mother said that if you had mentioned food combining or wheat intolerance back in 1992 they might have thrown you into a pond to see if you floated. I have no idea what that means, or who “they” are, but it was the first thing she had said to me in three days and I wanted to avoid another altercation, so I wrote it down. </p>
        <p>I discovered that eating so much starch was giving me severe headaches. This, I felt, might explain some of the heinous stuff that was happening in the world back in 1992—weirdos like Ross Perot and Jeffrey Dahmer, or all the rioting that went down in Los Angeles that year. Maybe the grunge look, too. </p>
        
        <p><i>Conclusion:</i></p>
        <p>In conclusion, 1992 was clearly a very confusing, difficult time in which to live in the United States of America. Having to use landlines and eat carbohydrates were hardships for the people to endure, but Americans are nothing if not resilient. If I had been a teen-ager in 1992, I would have been really challenged to find alternative ways to keep my life interesting, stay thin, and communicate with my peers. </p>
        <p>Speaking of which, someone is text-messaging me. I’m <i>so</i> grateful to live in 2005! :) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>

        <p>One of the more interesting tensions I have observed—since getting into
        	user experience design about five years ago—is the almost sibling-rivalry
        	tension between UX Designers and User Interface (UI) Developers. At the heart
        	of the tension between them is the fact that most UI <em>Developers</em> consider
        	themselves—and
        	sometimes rightfully so—to be UI <em>Designers</em>. The coding part is
        	like Picasso’s having to understand how to mix paint. It’s not the value they add, just the mechanics of delivering the creative concepts.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">When I worked on the Body of Knowledge Task Force for the Society for Technical Communication, the interesting question we wrestled with was: <em>What value does a technical communicator add above what an engineer who writes well offers?</em>UX Designers or UX Architects have the same problem to solve: <em>What value do we add that differentiates us from a UI developer who is user focused?</em> This
        	question strikes to the very heart of what differentiates us, as UX professionals,
        	from UI Developers. If <em>we</em> don’t provide a compelling answer, the only one left is that they code and we don’t. <em>Hmm</em>…, <em>not</em> the kind of value proposition I’d be comfortable with in this economy.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">I was recently reminded of the import of this problem,
        		when a UX Designer lamented that he had approached the Product Manager for
        		a new product with the question: “Have you thought about how to ensure the quality of the user experience?” The Product Manager’s answer was: “Oh yes, so-and-so is developing the UI,”
        	where <em>so-and-so</em> was a talented and user-focused UI Developer. So, how
        	do we break into the product-design process when something like that happens?</p>
        
        <!-- End pullquote -->
        <p class="sub-p">I thought about this on my drive home that night—on almost empty roads,
        	because the weatherman had predicted two millimeters of snow for Atlanta,
        	and the town was shut down in anticipation—wondering how to counter in
        	response to a statement like this: “We have a talented developer working
        	on it.” My
        	conclusion: I’d come back
        	with, “Great, he’s good! Where is he going to get his user data?”</p>
        <p class="sub-p">I think a mistake we sometimes make as UX Designers is
        		that we believe, if the race starts at wireframing, we will win. But if that’s
        		where the race starts, we have <em>no</em> advantage over a talented UI programmer.
        		It’s <em>not</em> like we have a
        	monopoly on secrets about design patterns and best practices for user interactions.
        	Some UI Developers have the same knowledge and, in some cases, were even the
        	ones who pioneered those patterns and best practices.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">In this column, I’ll examine the differences and
        		commonalities between the UX Designer and UI Developer roles and discuss how
        	the two can complement each other rather than compete.</p>
        <h2>Role Definitions</h2>
        
        <!-- End pullquote -->
        <p>The following descriptions of roles are a bit oversimplified, but provide
        	a workable framework for a discussion of the respective contributions of
        	UX Designers and UI Developers.</p>
        <ul><li><span class="run-in-head">UX Designer</span>—One who <em>designs</em> the
        		user experience for applications
        		<em>after</em> doing user and workflow analysis, producing user-centered design
        		artifacts such as personas, site maps, taxonomies, and wireframes. A UX Designer
        		may also conduct usability testing on prototypes or finished products to assess
        		the quality of a user experience.</li>
        	<li><span class="run-in-head">UI Developer</span>—One who <em>builds</em> user
        		interfaces that support the exchange of information between an application’s
        		users and its back-end processes and databases. This could be either
        		a fully dedicated role on a development team or a hat a developer who is
        		also responsible for coding the back-end processes might wear. A UI Developer’s
        		output is functional, testable, shippable code that lets users accomplish
        		their goals when using an application. The UI Developer is also responsible
        		for documentation that allows others to maintain their code.</li>
        </ul><p class="sub-p">Figure 1 illustrates the resultant overlap of traditional UX design skills
        	and UI development skills.</p>
        <p><span class="run-in-head">Figure 1</span>—Overlap between UX design and UI development skills</p>
        <img src="images/hughes_DesVsDev_Fig1.gif" alt="Overlap between UX design and UI development skills" width="317" height="226" class="figure-left" /><p class="sub-p">The area that tends to fall under the exclusive domain of UI
        	development includes the programming skills and knowledge. If you had a pin
        	labeled <em>Ruby on Rails</em>,
        	the UI development role would be a good place to stick it. The area that
        	tends to be the exclusive domain of User Experience relates to user research
        	and usability testing. Thus, if you had a pin labeled <em>card sorting</em>,
        	the UX side of the diagram would be its predictable home. The area of shared
        	expertise between the two roles includes knowledge of UI patterns and standards—the
        	widgets and elements that make up a user interface—as well as knowledge
        	about the software development process. This diagram is somewhat oversimplified—imagine
        	one where the borders are fuzzy rather than crisp lines of demarcation, and
        	you’d get closer to the truth.</p>
        <h2>How These Roles View Themselves and Each Other</h2>
        
        <!-- End pullquote -->
        <p>As I’ve worked with and listened to UX Designers and UI Developers,
        	I’ve
        	noticed how they view themselves and each other.  I
        	am reminded of the crime shows on TV and who is the primary crime solver
        	on each of them. You get a very different impression depending on which show
        	you watch. The CSI shows would lead us to believe that the forensic scientists
        	solve the crimes—including
        	the arrest and interrogation of suspects. Quincy ME tried to convince us
        	that it was the coroner. And patrol cops, detectives, profilers, prosecutors,
        	and defense attorneys might emerge as the central crime solvers, depending
        	on what show you watch.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">In short, if you ask a UX Designer and a UI Developer <em>who</em> is the
        	principal designer of the user experience, expect to hear a resounding <em>I
        	am!</em> from both of them.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">UX Designers see their validity as coming from the user
        		research that informs their designs. “We’ve talked to the customers,
        		and we know what they want.” UI
        		Developers see their validity as coming from their knowledge of the underlying
        		technology’s capabilities and constraints, along with their knowledge
        		of how to use the widget library at their disposal.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">And the tension between the people in these two roles has been
        	known to generate hard feelings. UX Designers resent the disregard developers
        	sometimes give their designs. And UI Developers feel that UX wireframes are
        	too static and don’t take into account
        	what they discover during the process of building a user interface. As
        	a design comes to life, the developers gain new insights—either while
        	interacting with the back-end processes or by testing the interactions they
        	are building.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">Another source of resentment that sometimes arises is
        		UX Designers’ feeling
        	that they’re getting left out of the development process as their wireframes
        	move into production and would like to be more involved when changes are
        	necessary. Conversely, UI Developers feel left out up front, where they feel
        	they could provide informative inputs about what the available technology
        		and tools can do and what they constrain.</p>
        <h2>Complementary Roles</h2>
        
        <!-- End pullquote -->
        <p>I think the two roles have distinct areas in which they respectively add their
        	unique value.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">The professional value UX Designers offer includes their processes and the
        	artifacts they create that help <em>inform and validate</em> design and development
        	around user needs. When we create a wireframe or prototype, it’s our way
        	of communicating data-driven—or at least process-driven—design considerations.
        	Such a design artifact should be a straw man that starts a collaborative
        	process of review and refinement. (Sometimes, being a UX Designer feels like
        	being a forensic sketch artist who draws a nose, any nose, so a witness can
        	say broader, thinner, whatever.) The best case is when a design deliverable
        	both visually communicates data-driven requirements <em>and</em> provides a working space
        	for collaborative input.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">The professional value UI developers offer  is their use
        		of technology to actually make the best user experience happen. In that
        	role, the UI Developer is a rightful participant in the design process. Bringing
        		a conceptual design to life is a creative function, and a UI Developer
        	can help the design mature and emerge by applying his or her own creativity
        	to the process. If a UX Designer were to insist that his wireframes were
        	unquestionable blueprints, we’d
        	lose the insights that could come from a UI Developer’s craftsmanship
        	in building that blueprint into a functional structure in which a user would
        	want to work.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">So, as UX professionals, our ultimate value is that we follow
        	a process that includes data gathering, data validation, collaborative design,
        	and usability testing of our designs. Our process can channel the talents
        	of  UI Developers and support their involvement in design <em>by informing
        	them of user needs, then validating that the emergent design meets those
        	needs</em>.</p>
        <p class="sub-p">If we think of ourselves just as better UI Designers, we might lose the value
        	proposition to talented UI Developers who can both design and code.<a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/images/ux-bug.gif" width="18" height="18" class="bug" /></a></p>

        <p class="comment_body"></p><p>I couldn’t agree more. Our involvement as UX designers shouldn’t start or end with wireframes. The research and conceptualizing that come before the wireframes and the testing and fine-tuning that come after them, are equally, if not more important when aiming for a great user experience in the final product. Sadly, for the sake of budget and planning, both clients and project managers are often inclined to leave out precisely those phases of the project plan. So, in order to achieve our goals, we need constantly to convince clients and project managers of the benefits of following a full UX design process. I know from experience this is not always easy, but it is not impossible.</p>

        <!--<div id="c3303">-->
        <p class="comment_body"></p><p>At the outset, I felt I disagreed with some of the assertions of this article, but I was won over by the end.</p>
        
        <p>One concern is captured in the UX Designer role definition. I don’t see the designer as the only person who does the design work, but rather the one who owns creating the design deliverables—specs and prototypes—and is accountable for the quality and completeness of those deliverables. Of course, as part of generating those deliverables, the designer does design things, but so do—or should—others. I see the role of the designer as the primary arbiter of a design process that includes many interested parties—customers, product managers, developers, QA engineers, documentation writers, and marketers.</p>
        
        <p>This may seem like something of a semantics issue; lets just call all that design, because that’s what a designer does. But there is value in acknowledging that much of the actual design—or components of a design—come from nondesigners.</p>
        
        <p>Just as the construction foreman on a job site doesn’t cut every stud or drive every nail, the designer on a complex project doesn’t design every feature down to the smallest detail. However, at the end of the day, both are responsible for the overall project. This understanding presents a situation where colleagues are clear on one another’s primary responsibilities, without—either intentionally or not—excluding contributions from the outside.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, it’s useful to have developers and other non-UX team members involved in customer research—listening in, taking notes, offering their impressions on what they saw and heard. Actually observing customers can be a very powerful learning experience, even for those not trained in user research techniques. It’s also interesting to find out what others on the team observe. So, though UX may own the research tasks, including the wider team can be highly beneficial to everyone.</p>
        
        <p>On the code ownership side, I’m not comfortable with stating that, “…the exclusive domain of UI development includes the programming skills and knowledge.” Again, the issue is ownership of the code deliverable rather than knowledge. Designers should have a working understanding of implementation technologies related to the projects they work on.</p>
        
        <p>I don’t expect an auto designer to be able to rebuild a motor, but I’d expect some basic understanding of a car’s systems. Same goes for an architect: I don’t expect him to build the structure, but I do expect a solid understanding of construction techniques. The same should be demanded of software designers. Not only does it inform the designer of possibilities and limiting concerns, but it allows the designer to speak with his customer—the developer.</p>
        
        <p>As designers, our primary customers aren’t users, but developers. They’re the people we need to communicate our ideas to. Without them, our designs won’t get built. Even though we are responsible for representing the needs of users, developers are the major consumers of design deliverables. Because of that, it’s important that we share a common language. This is why it’s essential for designers to have a grounding in development and, ideally, for developers to have exposure to design processes and methodologies.</p>
        
        <p>You won me over in the last section on complementary roles. I completely agree that the optimal situation is for designers and developers—and product managers and QA engineers and documentation writers—to collaborate and complement one another. Each team member has primary responsibilities, but individual contributions can overlap significantly—with writers suggesting design ideas, QA engineers suggesting implementation approaches, and the like. Certain individuals will naturally cross role boundaries more than others, but everyone should be encouraged to participate in all aspects of product development.</p>

I found your comment “As designers, our primary customers aren’t users, but developers” particularly insightful. When coaching writers on how to get published, I often comment that their audience is not the reader, it is the editor. Same principle.</p>

        <p>This weekend I experienced a snowcrash; a moment where the seemingly disparate pieces of information floating in my head came together. A synapse fired, a new connection was made, and I was brought to a new level of consciousness, a new way of seeing the world. In reading this over, it almost sounds obvious, but it took me a while to get here. I hope that by sharing with you, it’ll help you “get it” too. So let me take you on my thinking trail.</p>
        <p><strong>Insight #1: The Overview</strong></p>
        <p>The Future is Networks.</p>
        <p>This idea has been buzzing in my head for a long time. The first time I wrote it down was over a year ago, not really understanding what that meant, but it was an “intuition.” As time has gone by, this has seemed more and more probable, but I wasn’t sure how it fit together.</p>
        <p>The buzzing has been growing louder, and my mind was saying, ‘The future of Social Business is networks,’ ‘The future of education is networks,’ ‘The future of society is networks.’</p>
        <p>What did this mean?</p>
        <p>I know everyone is busy. Everyone is looking for some solution to how to make their situation better. If you will just bear with me, I’m going to expose you to what I found to be an incredibly powerful idea.<span id="more-800"></span></p>
        <p><strong>Insight #2: Where “we’re at” in History</strong></p>
        <p>We’re all aware that there’s something going on here. We’re not quite sure what, but it feels like we’re nearing a point where something must change if we’re to move forward.</p>
        <p>I’ll be honest with you – I don’t comprehend politics. I find it baffling at the national level and I feel impotent to do anything about it at the local level. (I tried volunteering last year on a committee in my town to promote Zero Waste and green energy. Every meeting was just talking and arguing, instead of devising solutions and implementing them. I got bored and resigned.)</p>
        <p>Economics also confuse me. I don’t understand why it’s set up so I paid over $14,000 towards my mortgage in 2009 in interest, and around $6 in principal. I also don’t understand how there was just a multi-billion dollar bailout of our financial industry, and yet <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/wall-st-bonuses-jumped-17-last-year_443384.html" target="_blank">Wall Street bonuses rose 17% to $20.3 billion last year</a>. I don’t think of myself as an idiot, but my mind *literally* can’t conceive how those two things could happen at the same time. It seems like the wealth of the entire nation is being funneled right to a couple thousand fortunate people, and all of us are still working pretty damn hard to make ends meet, yet ultimately supporting that model.</p>
        <p>Everything seems really bizarre and nonsensical, and it feels like it’s pointing to something. Lester Brown just wrote a really simple, relatively short, easy to digest post that lays out the situation better than I can – give it a read: <a href="http://billtotten.blogspot.com/2010/02/civilizational-tipping-point.html">A Civilizational Tipping Point</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Insight #3: The Underlying Forces At Work</strong></p>
        <p>While these things are unfolding at the surface level, something else has been going on underneath. Without really understanding the big picture, I’ve been trying to identify it. I wrote a post a few months ago, called <a href="http://emergentbydesign.com/2009/12/02/3-key-trends-shaping-the-web-and-society/" target="_blank">Three Key Trends Shaping the Web and Society</a>, where I tried to put my observation into words. The trends are:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change" target="_blank">Accelerating change</a></li>
        <li>Increasing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity" target="_blank">complexity</a> of information</li>
        <li>Growth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_technology" target="_blank">social technology</a></li>
        </ul><p>I explained what each of those means in the post, and added some nice graphics too. If you’re not familiar with those concepts, you can go check it out. For the sake of flow, I’m going to keep moving here, but essentially it means that the world is now more interconnected than it’s ever been because of social technology.</p>
        <p>Now, let’s call “social technology” anything that allows us to <strong>communicate information on a global level</strong>.</p>
        <p>And let’s also frame it in these terms: <strong>EVERYTHING is information</strong>.</p>
        <p>Not just these words on a screen, but also the physical objects we exchange; all the goods that keep the world going – food, furniture, clothing, toys, tchatchkis, all the “stuff.” It also includes the virtual objects – the services that we provide each other, the money we exchange, our voices talking to one another over Skype, and every other intangible thing.</p>
        <p>Every one of these things is actually <strong>a type of communication</strong>, a representation for something.</p>
        <p>A banana isn’t fruit, it’s nourishment. A couch isn’t furniture, it’s relaxation. A toy isn’t plastic from China, it’s fun. My Toyota isn’t a car, it’s transportation. My husband isn’t a man, he’s support, trust, and love. I could go on forever, but seriously take a look around you, and realize that you’re surrounded by stuff that means something else.</p>
        <p><strong>Think of it ALL as a type of information.</strong></p>
        <p>Now, if you can truly imagine every “thing” around you as information, and we’re now a globally interconnected world, all trading goods and services and knowledge, that’s A LOT of information.</p>
        <p>That’s complexity.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t that way when we lived in tribes or even villages or even Empires. It’s literally NEVER been fully globally connected, until now.</p>
        <p>It’s so complex, that we literally don’t know how to handle it. When we talk about “information overload,” it doesn’t just refer to all these activity streams on the web – it refers to EVERYTHING.</p>
        <p><strong>So what do we do about it?</strong></p>
        <p>Luckily, complexity isn’t something that’s never happened before. It may not have happened before for humans as a global civilization, but it happens in Nature all the time.</p>
        <p>An ant colony, the biosphere, the brain. All highly complex, yet functional.</p>
        <p>Why? How?</p>
        <p>If those systems “work,” shouldn’t we be able to imitate them in order for us to “work” too?</p>
        <p><strong>Well, actually, yes. </strong></p>
        <p>One of two things happens when a process reaches a certain level of complexity, and we can and have observed this. Over. And over. And over.</p>
        <p><strong>a. it compresses into simple patterns<br />
        b. it expands into chaos</strong></p>
        <p>So we’re kind of all struggling with avoiding chaos right now. We all still go about our day, go to work, entertain ourselves, have sex. We’re getting by. But we’re also wondering, somewhere in the back of our heads, how much longer things can go on like this, with all this uncertainty. Hopefully someone figures this out so we can go on with our lives and feel secure again about the future.</p>
        <p>Enter accelerating change.</p>
        <p>We don’t think about this part, because the idea of it doesn’t fit with the way we experience reality. We only live for so many years, and things feel like they unfold at approximately the same pace they always did.</p>
        <p>Let’s use “technology” as an example.</p>
        <p>Let’s first talk about technology as if that means just electronic technology.</p>
        <p>OK, we went from telegraph to radio to phone to TV to cell phone to computer to smartphone within about a hundred years, but that feels like it happened at a pretty natural pace, because we’ve lived in it as it happened, and we experience time on a linear scale.</p>
        <p>BUT, if you plot those changes on a graph, it actually doesn’t move in a slightly tilted line moving upwards at all.</p>
        <p>It swoops like the letter J. It gets faster at a faster rate.</p>
        <p>Now if you quickly back up, and understand that ‘technology’ isn’t actually just digital, but that technology includes all things that humans have used to simplify things when complexity increases, things begin to make A LOT of sense.</p>
        <p><strong>Every tool man has made, from the flint arrows to the wheel to civilization to systems of governance have ALL been in response to complexity. </strong></p>
        <p>Tribes got bigger and more complex and needed to hunt down food more effectively to feed more people, and they realized they needed more than a club. They needed an arrow. This worked.</p>
        <p>[quickening]</p>
        <p>They got bigger still and couldn’t be chasing after food all the time, so they domesticated animals and developed agriculture. This worked.</p>
        <p>[quickening]</p>
        <p>They got more complex and different people started doing different things, making stuff, and wanted to trade their stuff for other people’s stuff. The developed a barter system. This worked.</p>
        <p>[quickening]</p>
        <p>They got more complex and this had to be organized into some kind of structure, so systems of governance were implemented. Different versions emerged all over the world, but they all had something in common: There was a scarcity of resources, and so the systems were competition-based. They had to be, because Nation 1 wanted to retain more resources than Nation 2. It wanted to protect or control its own interests, its physical resources, the intellectual capital of its society. This ultimately exploited a ton of people in order to work, but it worked. At least for the folks on top.</p>
        <p>[quickening]</p>
        <p>Then it got more complex, more interrelated and interdependent. This brings us to the present.</p>
        <p>It’s now become so incredibly complex and enmeshed, that each of us now has access to EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET in less than 6 steps. Even with billions of people on the planet, we can reach literally anyone in 6 steps. That means we can access anyone’s resources in 6 steps. Their skills, their knowledge, their capital, their influence. Any resource.</p>
        <p>What does this mean?</p>
        <p><strong>We’ve transitioned past the point of scarcity. </strong></p>
        <p>Take a second to let that soak in.</p>
        <p>There is no longer such thing as scarcity.</p>
        <p>There are only misallocated resources.</p>
        <p>It happened right under our noses while we’ve been trying to solve problems that are not just past the point of fixing, but irrelevant.</p>
        <p><strong>The only thing we have left is the scarcity mentality</strong>. Any actual problem that needs to be addressed is already possible, right now.</p>
        <p><strong>The Final Insight: The Future is Networks</strong></p>
        <p>If you’ve made it this far, either this</p>
        <p>a.) doesn’t make sense to you,<br />
        b.) is something you already knew,<br />
        or<br />
        c. ) your heart is racing because you’re getting it</p>
        <p>Let me share the final pieces that clicked this into place for me:</p>
        <p>I never really understood what it meant when people said, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”</p>
        <p>I never really understood what the point of going to a ‘business mixer event’ and “networking” meant.</p>
        <p>It all seemed not only intimidating, but damn near impossible. How do you meet people? How do you make a business connection? How do you build trust with strangers so that you’re not strangers anymore, but might help each other. (And help is anything from lending your neighbor a hammer, to making a referral to help someone maybe land a job, to emailing or tweeting a link online to information you think someone might find useful.) Help comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>
        <p>I tried getting a job the old-fashioned way, sending out applications and crossing my fingers, hoping somehow my worth would be reflected on that dreaded piece of paper we call the resume.</p>
        <p>(Oh, and by the way, I’m not just a recent college grad with no work experience. I used to have a six-figure income as a corporate executive. I quit because it was soul-deadening.)</p>
        <p>My other prerequisite for a job was it had to be interesting and meaningful and fulfilling. Tall order. Nothing panned out.</p>
        <p>So I started to experiment online. I had this feeling inside that “I’m worth it, and I want people to know.”</p>
        <p><strong>But what is it exactly that I’m worth? What is it that I “do”? Where does the value lie? What am I actually trying to convey? </strong></p>
        <p>I realized we all have skills that we learn, expertise that we develop, a trade, a craft, an art. Those things are different for all of us, and they develop and grow over time as we learn through experience. But underneath that we have strengths.</p>
        <p>Strengths are something we’re born with, and they get better over time too, just like our skills, but strengths “come naturally.” It’s the stuff that makes us us. Maybe your strength is that you’re super generous and empathetic, or you’re assertive and strategic, or you’re a good storyteller, or a network weaver, or you know what people really mean when they say something, or you can anticipate what people want.</p>
        <p>I hope you know what I’m talking about, because we all have these core strengths.</p>
        <p>If you have any connection with your strengths, if you have acknowledged and pursued developing them, it’s probably reflected in what you do for a living. For instance, if you’re the generous empathetic type you might work in customer service or a non-profit, if you’re strategic you might be an exec or an entrepreneur, if you’re a storyteller you might be doing video or journalism or painting or music, if you’re a network weaver you might be in sales. If you’re not in touch with your underlying strengths, and therefore not applying them, you’re probably doing a job that’s making you really, really unhappy.</p>
        <p>My strength is the ability to see patterns.</p>
        <p>It’s what enabled me to write this post. People call me “insightful.” I have the ability to see stuff that other people don’t see, even when it’s staring them right in the face. (I’ve been calling this process “metathinking,” and I’m going to try to explain how it works for me in upcoming posts.)</p>
        <p>So I figured out my strength and ventured online to share it, because it clearly wasn’t being appreciated in the “real world.” I had no idea how ‘seeing patterns’ would be an asset that would bring me any type of opportunity, because I’d never been appreciated for it before. Well, maybe I’d been appreciated for it in small ways throughout life, but our memories are short, our egos are weak, and we need constant positive reinforcement to feel any kind of worth in this society. And society isn’t really set up to give it to us, so we all feel kind of impotent most of the time.</p>
        <p>Feeling impotent isn’t just depressing, it also makes us frustrated, angry, and fearful, because we feel like we have absolutely no control over what’s happening to us in our lives. Kind of like how we feel when we’re sitting in dead-stop traffic and have someplace to be, or when a corporation exploits us and there’s no one who will punish them for it, or when the government isn’t able to provide us adequate education or healthcare, even though we bust our tails and pay our taxes.</p>
        <p>We have no trust in any of it anymore, and we’re angry.</p>
        <p>But all of that seems really big and overwhelming, so I just ventured online to see what I can do about it for me. I can’t single-handedly change the system, I can only change my own situation. So I started this blog. I started writing about the patterns I was seeing. Explaining trends I was seeing in simple language, distilling down big concepts into words that people could “get.”</p>
        <p>(By the way, I made the commitment to try this little experiment in September. It’s March now. It’s been just around six months.)</p>
        <p>Along with the blog, I started a Twitter account. I opened the account the week that Twitter Lists was introduced. That was in October. I didn’t use Twitter before that for the same reason I don’t attend ‘networking events’: I had absolutely no idea who I’d want to interact with, or how. No one ever taught me “networking.”</p>
        <p>The reason that <strong>Lists changed everything</strong> is because it allows you to identify who people are following <strong>in a way that is contextually meaningful</strong>. People organize people into categories that are useful for them; either by geographic location (“NY-friends”), by profession (“design-thinking”, “community-managers”, “social-crm”), by power (“most-influential-in-tech”), by intelligence (“thought-leaders”, “best-mindcasters-i-know”), and any other number of categories that they see fit.</p>
        <p>Whether they realize they’ve done it or not, they’ve provided you with a free resource. <strong>They’re publicly exposing you to their network. </strong></p>
        <p>It’s now up to you to determine that person’s credibility and reputation, and how much weight you put in their categories. (If they come across like a moron to you, but have a list called ‘thought-leaders,’ you might not find their opinion of a thought leader useful. Or maybe it’s really useful, and you’re the moron. That’s for you to figure out. <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  )</p>
        <p><strong>So what do you need to do? </strong></p>
        <p>Well, it takes a little homework. What I did was go to <a href="http://listorious.com/" target="_blank">Listorious.com</a>. I looked at all the Top Lists that were interesting to me, and started following every single person who I thought I could learn from. That means I looked through their tweetstream to see if it was filled with potentially useful links to info, and I also clicked through to their personal website.</p>
        <p>(On every Twitter bio page the user can link to their website. This is really important. Everyone should have a website. It doesn’t have to be professionally designed, it can be a simple free blog, but you need to have a place where you show off your work, whatever your work may be. And not just a link to your LinkedIn resume. That’s just an assertion of who you are – you telling everyone who you work for and the tasks you do there. That IS NOT who you are. You need to have some kind of site that SHOWS who you really are. Otherwise, it’s a lot harder to get a feel for what you’re all about just by looking at your tweetstream.)</p>
        <p>Not everyone will follow you back. It’s ok. You’ll continue to follow them because what they provide you with is <strong>a curated source of information</strong>. One example that comes to mind, for me, is Maria Popova’s stream, under the username <a href="http://twitter.com/brainpicker" target="_blank">@brainpicker</a>. I follow her, she doesn’t follow me back or engage with me in any way, but her tweets are consistently interesting, so I keep following. You’ll have some of that, and it’s fine, because it provides YOU with cool content to then tweet to the people who follow you. I follow almost 200 people who don’t follow me. No hard feelings.</p>
        <p><strong>How many people should I follow?</strong></p>
        <p>So now you’re starting to build up a network of interesting people to follow. Everyone has a different suggestion of how many people to follow, so it’ll be your call. But in order to be able to start spotting patterns, I’d recommend a minimum of 150. This will take time if you want to do it right. Just start with the most interesting people first.</p>
        <p>Then watch.</p>
        <p>See what those people are tweeting about and who they retweet. By seeing who they retweet, you start to understand who’s in their network. An excellent tool to aid in this process is <a href="http://apps.asterisq.com/mentionmap/#" target="_blank">mentionmap</a>. You just enter in a username, and it shows you exactly who that person talks to the most, and who their closest connections are. I’m consistently surprised when I use this tool, because there is ALWAYS at least one person in a stranger’s network that is either also in my network, or I’ve at least seen their name go through my tweetstream. This is a constant reminder that all of us are connected in under 6 steps.</p>
        <p>Then start tweeting.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you’ve set up your blog or site where you update information about who you are and what you think about. Start tweeting a mix of retweets of interesting information you find from other people, and links to information about you. Oh. And when I say “information about you,” <strong>it HAS to be a gift</strong>.</p>
        <p>What do I mean by ‘gift’?</p>
        <p>It means you’re not selling anything or talking about the company you work for or wasting people’s time with something inane. People are busy, and won’t waste their attention on you if you’re not providing value.</p>
        <p><strong>This gift is something you give for free.</strong> That could mean a blog post you wrote that is filled with information someone might find useful, like a ‘how-to’, or an insight into something in your industry, or a tip that’s helped you be more productive, or a link that shows something you made if you’re an artist or artisan, or anything that shows off one of those inherent natural strengths of yours.</p>
        <p>As you observe the people in your network more, and start talking to them, you realize that these are JUST PEOPLE on the other end.</p>
        <p>This is going to be very bizarre and mindblowing at first, because we’re not really used to the idea that strangers could be potential allies that would help us. But it’ll get more comfortable over time. And you’ll start to get a feel for their personalities and their interests, and if you pay attention to who they are paying attention to, you get a feel for who they know. And again you’ll notice how closely we’re all connected.</p>
        <p>But, there are always holes in networks, and spots where you can make an introduction that could lead to a discovery. You don’t even have to “know” the person you’re introducing. You might be following a person who tweets stuff similar to <a href="http://twitter.com/brainpicker" target="_blank">@brainpicker</a>, but you notice they don’t follow her. So you just tweet to this person: “hey, you should check out <a href="http://twitter.com/brainpicker" target="_blank">@brainpicker</a>, you might enjoy her tweets.” That’s all. That was a gift, a free offer of a connection.</p>
        <p>You just earned a brownie point.</p>
        <p>As you get better at this, you’ll start noticing that some people are working on similar projects or ideas, but they don’t know about each other. You realize that they could probably mutually benefit if they exchanged information. So you introduce them. (Again, you don’t have to “know” either party, all you have to know is that there’s a connection there to be made). I might notice a couple scattered people interested in social change, but realizing they could be more effective if they worked together, instead of repeating the same work in different locations, so I say “hey <a href="http://twitter.com/CDEgger" target="_blank">@CDEgger</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/HildyGottlieb" target="_blank">@HildyGottlieb</a> meet <a href="http://twitter.com/openworld" target="_blank">@openworld</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/kengillgren" target="_blank">@kengillgren</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ToughLoveforX" target="_blank">@toughloveforX</a>“. I’ve never met any of these people in real life, but I think they could benefit from knowing each other.</p>
        <p>This takes effort and time. It’s work. And it’s unpaid.</p>
        <p><strong>So why on Earth would you waste your time doing this?</strong></p>
        <p>Because something interesting happens when you start sending people links to information that they can turn around and apply in the real world, and when you introduce people to each other which allows them to collaborate on projects or ideas in the real world.</p>
        <p><strong>It builds trust.</strong></p>
        <p>This was literally a revelation for me.</p>
        <p>As I started interacting more with these real life humans in an online space, I couldn’t understand why people were being so nice to me and sharing information with me and providing me with resources.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s because I’m earning their trust.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This is the most fundamental, essential, critical thing we need in order to get ourselves out of this whole mess.</strong></p>
        <p>I now have a network of people, none of who I’ve ever met in real life (yet), with whom I exchange value with on a daily basis and build trust. In under six steps, I have access to anyone on the planet, and if I have access to the person, I have access to their resources. Resources like their expertise, their social connections, and their influence.</p>
        <p>Do you know how this makes me feel?</p>
        <p><strong>Empowered.</strong></p>
        <p>Not powerful. Empowered.</p>
        <p>Let me give you the book definition of empowerment:</p>
        <blockquote readability="1"><p><strong>“To equip or supply with an ability; enable.”</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p>This hit me like an absolute ton of bricks.</p>
        <p>All of this free giving and sharing <strong>actually does something tremendously valuable</strong>.</p>
        <p>It enables us.</p>
        <p><strong>It gives us the capacity to access the resources we need to take an action in the world.</strong></p>
        <p>I went for a walk through NYC this weekend thinking about this, and I passed by a homeless man sitting on the street begging for change.</p>
        <p>At that moment, I realized that I was looking at a man without a network.</p>
        <p>I don’t know what happened to him along the way or how he got there, but at some point he lost access to the resources that would empower and enable him to act. He possessed strengths, somewhere inside, but he had absolutely no way to leverage them, develop them, or use them in a beneficial way. He was a lone node, or at the most, a node within a network that possessed no resources that they knew how to use to their benefit.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s networks.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The answer is networks.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Networks solve the problem of complexity.</strong></p>
        <p>Since my blog/Twitter experiment started in September, the effort I’ve put in has helped me to begin forming a network of strong and weak ties. At first, I got a few retweets of my tweets; then more comments on my blog; then some people of greater influence started tweeting my posts, giving me more exposure; then a few people asked if I would do guest posts on their blogs; then I was asked to speak at a business conference here in NYC coming up in April; then I was hired by Duke University to teach a Futures course this July; and I literally am<strong> just waiting to see what happens next</strong>.</p>
        <p>It feels like magic, but the process has been completely practical, and actually kind of felt like a game.</p>
        <p>It turns out, life is EXACTLY like a game. If you can access the right resources, you can win.</p>
        <p><strong>Now here’s the kicker.</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone can win.</p>
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system" target="_blank">By definition</a>, a complex system can only function with independently acting agents who collaborate. That means you still have your own personal interests that you’re serving, but in order to serve your interests, your actions have to indirectly serve the whole.</p>
        <p>And this is not just theory, there’s proof.</p>
        <p>You may not know the name Elinor Ostrom, but she just won the Nobel Prize for <a href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/145889/the_woman_who_just_might_save_the_planet_and_our_pocketbooks -" target="_blank">her work on cooperation in economics</a>. Turns out she did research that showed that the “Tragedy of the Commons” wouldn’t be the necessary effect of a globally cooperative society, as we’ve assumed. She showed, <strong>in practice</strong>, that this could <em>actually work</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>So what does all this mean?</strong></p>
        <p>I’ve tried my best to take some incredibly complex topics and distill them down to something that makes sense. I hope the examples are painting the picture of what’s going on.</p>
        <p>This whole online thing is essentially <em><strong>a simulation</strong></em> – it mimics the actual world. The relationships you build online and the networks you build online aren’t just made between screennames and avatars, <strong>they’re with real life people</strong>.</p>
        <p>Turns out, we’re all actually in this together, all trying to figure out a way that we can all utilize our strengths, connect, collaborate, and survive. If helping each other and building trust is the way to make it work, let’s make it work.</p>
        <p>All this time, I was thinking way too big, trying to understand how to change the world. I kept asking myself, “but how do we leverage networks?”</p>
        <p>We don’t.</p>
        <p><strong>We ARE the network. Networks self-organize. We only have to leverage ourselves, and the infrastructure gets built. </strong></p>
        <p>Each one of us has to create our own ecosystem of relationships that will be beneficial to us personally. We’ll all have some relationships that overlap, but none of us will have the exact same set. The point is that we want to build trust so that when we need help we know who we can access to help us.</p>
        <p>Now imagine, if you’re a entrepreneur, or an organization, or a non-profit, or a corporation, and you understand this message and spread it to each and every one of your employees. What happens when your entire organization of people, as a unit, is a network in itself, but each person also has their personal networks of relationships to draw on, which extend beyond the organization?</p>
        <p><strong>You then have an INCREDIBLE competitive advantage.</strong> (Yeah, there can still be ‘competition’ in a collaborative society, it’s just different, because it’s based on trust.)</p>
        <p>Your organization becomes agile. It becomes a learning network, where every person has access to information that can be shared, interpreted, and implemented. You’ll be able to identify weak signals faster, come up with solutions faster, and adapt to change faster.</p>
        <p>The world will keep moving. It’s accelerating at an accelerating rate. The ONLY WAY to deal with it is not to cling to the old hierarchies and silos and pride and egos. We have to understand that we can only deal with this as a fully connected system.</p>
        <p>And the really crazy part is: <strong>we already have everything we need to make this happen. It’s already in place.</strong></p>
        <p>All that needs to change is the mindset.</p>
        <p>Let me repeat:</p>
        <p><strong>All that needs to change is the mindset.</strong></p>
        <p>So how are we going to fix everything?</p>
        <p>I have absolutely no idea. That’s kind of the point. None of us do, individually, or even as groups. The system needs to be interwoven first, and then we’ll collectively know how to figure it out. We’ll be flexible, adaptive, and intelligent, because we’ll be able to quickly and freely allocate resources where they’re needed in order to make change.</p>
        <p><strong>The first step is to build our networks.</strong></p>
        <p>This all hit me like a bolt of lightening, a pattern that emerged out of all the complex information.</p>
        <p>It’s an option that seems not only possible, but preferable, and comes with a plan that’s implementable immediately.</p>
        <p>I thought that made this an idea worth spreading.</p>
        <p>If you think so too, pass it on.</p>

        	<p>I think our panel at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> went well on Tuesday – I was expecting light attendance, as many people had already left – but those around for the panel <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23mbsp">seemed to enjoy it</a>. A huge thank you to <a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com">James</a>, <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/">Mike</a>, <a href="http://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/">Ben</a> and <a href="http://www.girlwonder.com/">Molly</a>, for being awesome and interesting. </p>
        
        	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/antimega/4443750430/" title="go team by antimega, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4443750430_d2e2e827e2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="go team" border="0" /></a></p>
        
        	<p>Also, thanks to <a href="http://www.newspaperclub.co.uk/">Newspaper Club</a> (Ben again, <a href="http://tomtaylor.co.uk/">Tom</a>, <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/">Russell</a>) and all the contributors to the newspaper they printed on Monday night to hand out at the panel. It was a huge effort, and the sound of quietly rustling newspapers made it all worth it.</p>
        
        	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/antimega/4439483055/" title="the papers by antimega, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4439483055_e910c7ed76.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the papers" border="0" /></a></p>
        
        	<p>I’m unused to panels, especially ones that worked well, and I think a combination of us all having different takes on the topic, plus real examples of things we’ve made, led to somewhere interesting. There’s still a lot more to say on all this, though, and lots of other interesting people doing interesting things. </p>
        
        	<p>Here’s my short talk introducing the topic:</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.002.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p><strong>alchemy and transmogrification</strong> </p>
        
        	<p>The title of the panel came from things that two groups I know were talking about – design studio <span class="caps">BERG</span> talking about media design, and <span class="caps">RIG</span> talking about post-digital.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.003.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>This is how <a href="http://berglondon.com"><span class="caps">BERG</span></a> talk about media design – the space between media, convergence and new formats and experiences.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.004.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p><a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2009/01/meet-the-new-schtick.html">Russell Davies</a> uses the term post-digital to talk about moving on screen experiences into the real world – screens are inherently boring and mundane, and people are now growing up in a world where digital is natural, and not special.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.005.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>This comes at a time when we – you, me, anybody – can play and create with things <br />
        previously unimaginable. Maps, books, newspapers, but also textiles, electronics, servers. <br />
        They’re at least cheap enough and good enough to try things and prototype. We also think about the nearly recently possible, using smoke and mirrors to build design near-fictions – often videos (such as <span class="caps">BERG</span>’s <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2009/12/17/magplus/">Mag+</a> magazine reader). <br />
        Today, we’ll mainly be talking about the brave new world of paper.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.006.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>So what’s hard with using these media? Well, they’re normally made by companies unused to dealing with individuals and tinkerers. So you need companies to act as arbiters between the inquisitive and the machines – such as <a href="http://www.newspaperclub.co.uk">Newspaper Club</a>. And this is going to keep happening – taking next, maybe, the ad market online, giving individuals access to urban screens and marketing in real, public space.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.007.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>Printers, banks, Paypal, Royal Mail / <span class="caps">USPS</span>, envelope manufacturers … these are all platforms for us. So are cheap electronics platforms such as Arduino and invisible services such as Pachube.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.008.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>Then we stick them together in different combinations to make interesting things.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.009.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>It lets us sketch – as we’re used to doing on the web – to try things and see what works, what feels right, and what doesn’t work.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.010.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>And we can ﬂex information into other forms – if a newspaper isn’t right, maybe a book. Maybe a website. Maybe a talking Internet rabbit.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.011.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>And, if they’re good, we can easily try to sell them. At any scale, it’s easier to get people to buy something physical that a nebulous invisible service.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.012.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>And that lets us keep exploring. Creating experiments with the things we’re passionate about.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.013.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>My hobby (or hobbyhorse) is about these three things – curation, criticism and craft. They’re things that I can’t see Google being able to replicate just with a crowd. But – the Internet does give individuals, amateurs, hobbyists the power to create audiences around these things.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.014.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>(Sorry, your profession just got rolled over onto by a crowd of “ﬂeshy gauze”. Don’t worry, it won’t hurt, as long as you don’t wriggle too much.)</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.015.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p>So I’ll show a few of my experiments. <br /><a href="http://twitter.com/localondon">@localondon</a> is a service curating London art exhibitions and events. Not automatic – hand picked, curated, and then using Hootsuite and Twitter to deliver in a perfectly timely fashion, so you know about and don’t miss interesting things. A web service without a website.</p>
        
        	<p><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.016.png" width="500" height="375" /></p>
        
        	<p><a href="http://asitistoday.com/newsagent/">As It Is To-Day.</a> – a newspaper liberating awesomeness from 200 years of books – travel guides, restaurant reviews, maps, photographs, adverts. It was originally going to be a weblog – and still probably will be – but it’s easier to design and print a newspaper than create the website I want. Also easier to read.</p>
        
        	<p><a href="http://asitistoday.com/newsagent/"><img src="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/presentations/sxsw2010/sxsw_ch.017.png" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
        
        	<p>And (of course) <a href="http://asitistoday.com/newsagent/">it’s for sale</a>. <br />
        What’s next? More issues of As It Is To-day … images from Google Books and the Internet Archive aren’t always good enough for print. So I’ll be building a book scanner and scanning more of my own library. <br />
        Also modern travel guides – currently walking the Thames Path in London to make a guide about that, city guides … books? websites? <br />
        Thanks.</p>&#13;
